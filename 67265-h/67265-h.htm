<p>At the outset of this memoir it must be said, that it is in fact a joint work by
the first discoverer of the remarkable hypostomic structure to be described, Herr G.
<span class="smcap">Liljevall</span>, and by myself. A considerable portion of this work belongs to him as he
with great discernment searched for a large amount of the material, prepared it as to
be fit for the many microscopic sections which he executed, and at last with his well
known artistic skill drew the figures. My share, again, in the common work consists in
the supervision of the figures, in the arrangement of the observations and details in a
coherent form, in which suggestions and remarks of Herr <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> have been of great
use, further to write the descriptions and to make all the necessary researches in literature,
so whatever may be faulty in these respects must be laid to my charge.</p>

<p>It is well known amongst pal&aelig;ontologists that the hypostoma of the trilobites has been
the particular object for research and description by a few authors, as <span class="smcap">Barrande</span>, <span class="smcap">Nov&aacute;k</span>
and <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> and some passing notes concerning it are given in the descriptive works
of other authors. In the following pages reference is often made to them and I may
here give a list of the chief works and the abbreviations with which they are cited below

<p>Before proceeding further I shall give a general
representation of the shape of the hypostoma. This
enigmatic part of the trilobite skeleton resembles as to
its outline a heraldic shield being broad at its anterior
margin, gradually tapering towards the posterior extremity,
which generally is acuminated or, as in the Asaphid&aelig;,
bifid. In a few, as Deiphon, Remopleurides, it is
nearly square. Its exterior surface may consist of a
single field or he divided transversally into two or three
fields, according to the presence of one or two shallow
grooves. These are transverse, curved forwards near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span>
the lateral margins and may be designated as the anterior groove and the posterior groove.
Beside these grooves there are in some instances others, one on each of the lateral margins,
parallel with these. On both sides of the anterior margin a protuberance, sometimes
of considerable length, stands out. They are bent backwards towards the interior side of the
hypostoma and in some genera, as Dysplanus, assume the shape of long, acuminated,
halfways hollow horns. These protuberances were called &raquo;<i>ailes</i>&raquo; by <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> and it is
best to retain this term, in english &raquo;wings&raquo;, in spite of its being not quite expressive. A
smaller posterior pair lies nearer to the posterior margin and these wings are so much
bent backwards, that they are seldom visible from the outside. They are prolongations
from the &raquo;duplicature&raquo; or the narrow fold of the posterior margins round the interior
side of the hypostoma.</p>

<p>For the rest the whole exterior surface is covered with terrace lines running concentrically
and varying according to the different genera and even species. Many other
genera, again, as Acidaspis, Calymmene, Homalonotus, Dalmanites etc., are devoid of them
and instead granulated or smooth.</p>

<p>In the plurality of species there are two tiny patches or macul&aelig;, sometimes elevated
above the surrounding surface like tubercles and so they have also been called by
some authors. But I have preferred to use the name &raquo;macula&raquo; for them, as the plurality
does not form tubercles. They are generally entirely smooth and glossy and situated
next to the anterior groove, either above it or in it, at a regular distance from each
other and the lateral margins. They may form a sunk spot or, as commonly, an ovoid
or elliptic area surrounded by a linear elevated border. Thus amongst the Asaphid&aelig;.
In others, again, (Bronteus, Ill&aelig;nus etc.) they form a moderately elevated tubercle. The
direction in which they are oriented in relation to the longitudinal axis of the hypostoma
is quite as variable. It is to the closer consideration of the nature of these macula
that this memoir will be chiefly devoted. They have been delineated several times,
but very seldom has any accurate attention been paid to them by previous authors. It is
highly doubtful if <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> ever alluded to them, when he in his &raquo;Syst&egrave;me Silurien de
Boh&eacute;me&raquo; vol. I, p. 156, in describing the hypostoma, says: &raquo;Cette plaque bomb&eacute;e porte
souvent des saillies et des empreintes creuses, dans le voisinage de la bouche. Leurs
formes varient suivant les esp&egrave;ces mais en conservant toujours les caract&egrave;res g&eacute;n&eacute;riques.
Nous les consid&eacute;rons comme les points d'attaches des muscles et des m&agrave;choires.&raquo; In the
numerous specific descriptions in his grand work there is never any mention made of
the macula and in contemplating the figures and reading the explanations of these, we
shall find that he meant something more comprehensive with his statement, to wit, the
entire groove where these tubercular macula are situated.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Nov&aacute;k's</span> third paper, p. 4, we see the figures of two Phillipsi&aelig; with tubercles
on the hypostoma and he says only that in the anterior groove there are two such symmetrically
placed ... glandular intumescences.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> &raquo;In der Mittelfurche sitzen 2 kleine symmetrisch gelegene, nicht immer dentliche dr&uuml;senartige An
schwellungen.&raquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> again in his paper on the &raquo;Ausbildung des Hypostoms&raquo; devotes a page
(p. 19) to explain the nature of these macul&aelig; and regards them as the exterior marks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span>
of two muscular impressions or points of attachment on the inside for muscles which
have attached the hypostoma to the walls of the glabella or the head. The real nature
of these so variable tubercular macul&aelig; is, however, a quite different one, as we
hope to be able to demonstrate in describing all their varying shapes in several genera.</p>

<p>The interior surface of the hypostoma shows all the protuberances of the exterior
surface (tubercular macul&aelig;, spines and granulations) as shallow pits, the exterior grooves
being on the contrary elevated ridges. For the rest the interior surface is smooth and
its margins are posteriorly covered with a more or less broad duplicature, from the lateral
margins of which the posterior wings project.</p>

<p>The manner in which <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> became aware of the interesting structural features
of which I am going to give an account, is as follows. We were about to describe
and delineate some new or not sufficiently known Upper Silurian trilobites from the island
of Gotland. In order to draw a specimen of Bronteus polyactin <span class="smcap">Angelin</span>, which is rarely
found in the Wenlock and Ludlow strata of Gotland, <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> was preparing and
cleaning its hypostoma. The shape of this hypostoma, as represented in <a href="#Plate_II">pl. II</a> fig. 22,
is clypeiform, tapering towards the posterior margin, which is regularly tongue shaped.
The anterior margin is faintly curved and at both sides elongated in a broad, pointed
wing. Its exterior surface is divided in three transverse fields, defined through two shallow
grooves, the anterior and largest field occupying more than the moiety, the median
one is crescent-shaped and narrow, and the posterior one is nearly of the same size
and confluent with the lateral borders of the hypostoma, which near the median transverse
axis of the latter project in a blunt angle on each side. The surface, for the rest
smooth, is covered by concentric, irregular terrace lines. On the inferior edge of the
upper groove two small tubercles are situated, one on each side closer to the lateral
margins than to the central axis. The size of their longitudinal axis amounts to 0,96 mm.
in the shortest and to 1,07 mm. in the longest specimens. This axis is parallel with the
groove and consequently oblique to the longitudinal axis of the hypostoma. They are
oblong or ellipsoid, their inferior apices bluntly pointed or rounded, varying a little
as seen in the three specimens figured, (Pl. II figs. 23, 24, 25). For about two thirds their
surface is perfectly smooth or rather glossy, and the lower third is covered with a compact
accumulation of small granules. The extension of this peculiar accumulation varies, being
somewhat larger in some specimens, and the limit which runs oblique towards the glossy
part is more or less curved. Such a granule taken single is of the extremest minuteness,
measuring 0,055 millimeter at the highest. Their outline is perfectly circular and semiglobose.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> saw this group of granules he was at once struck with the
perfect, outward similarity between them and the facets of the compound eyes on the
upper surface of the head of this same species, and I fully concurred in the same view.
It now became of importance to ascertain whether the intimate structure also corresponded
in both, and microscopic sections were accordingly prepared. Although not so clear as in
other species of this genus a vertical section of a cephalic eye (Pl. II fig. 21) shows a
median row of black spots which compared with other sections (Pl. II fig. 9) must be the
centres of the badly preserved lenses. This is confirmed by the horizontal section (Pl.
II fig. 20) where the well known image of the polyedric facets appeared. In the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
manner the granulated spot of the hypostoma shows in a vertical section even more
clearly (<a href="#Plate_II">pl. II</a> fig. 27) the elongate, coherent lenses with a black centre and the
polyedric form of the lenses in a horizontal section (Pl. II fig. 26). The assumption of
a pair of small adventive eyes on the exterior side of the hypostoma became thus based
on the clear evidence of the perfect structural agreement between them and the eyes of
the head. But it was necessary to strengthen this evidence through extended researches
on the hypostoma of as many trilobite genera as possible and also to study the intimate
structure of the cephalic eyes in as many genera as could be accessible.</p>

<p>We shall now give first a general account of the structure of the eyes in the trilobites
as far as we have been able to study them, and then proceed to describe the
macul&aelig; of the various genera, which we have observed.</p>

<p>With regard to the presence or non existence of visual organs, we must remark
that a considerably greater number of genera than those which unanimously have been
regarded as blind, also are devoid of eyes though they still by many authors are ranked
amongst the oculate ones and we then had better first to make a review of them and
thus to eliminate them from the number of the oculate species.</p>

<p>In the chaos of generic forms and in the great disagreement which prevails as to
the systematizing of the trilobites of the Cambrian time, there is a thorough revision of
them highly needed by a person having access not only to the literature, but also to the
original specimens. It is almost impossible in the present state of things to tell with
any degree of certainty how many well established genera had been living during that
period. Hence the difficulty of fixing the systematic names of many specimens the visual
organs of which are to be described.</p>

<p>My researches on the visual organs of the Cambrian trilobites are founded on the
Angelinian Collection in the Swedish State Museum together with collections of foreign
species, but also largely on the waste European and American literature, though we have
to deplore the often occurring inexactitude of the figures, especially in the older works,
and constructed or schematized figures in some of the newer ones, which give a quite false
notion of the structure. There is no lack of figures to show how it ought to be, according
to preconceived notions and, on the other hand, a great scarcity of representations,
to show how it really is. In spite of all this there is a sufficiently great number of
well established facts to demonstrate the organization of the Cambrian genera.</p>

<p>The trilobites of this division may be called blind only in so far as they have no
eyes on the upper surface of the head, but they may have been provided with visual
organs, though more imperfect, on the hypostoma as really seems to have been the case
with some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span></p>

<p>According to the structure of the head shield the blind trilobites may be subdivided
into the following well characterized groups. These are:</p>

and without the least trace of anything that might be called a visual organ and they
must consequently be considered as totally blind. In contradistinction to the following
groups, excepting the oldest Olenellid&aelig;, the head consists of only three parts, 1) glabella,
and 2-3) the two fixed cheeks. These genera range from the oldest zone in which
hitherto trilobites have been found, that of Olenellus (Holmia) Kjerulfi, to the zone of
Paradoxides Forchhammeri, and some, as Agnostus, even continue as high in the Lower
Silurian series as in the Brachiopod schists. Beside Agnostus the other genera are Conocoryphe
(seven species in the Swedish Cambrium), Toxotis, Ctenocephalus (?), Elyx, Aneuacanthus,
Conophrys and Microdiscus.</p>

<p>&raquo;Harpides&raquo; breviceps <span class="smcap">Ang.</span>, also belongs here. Anopocare of <span class="smcap">Angelin</span> should also be
regarded as one of this group. But it cannot be retained any longer because it is founded
on two other, well known forms, being, according to <span class="smcap">Linnarsson</span>, Peltura scarab&aelig;oides
(pl. 27 fig. 1, a in Pal. Scand.) and young specimens of Sph&aelig;rophthalmus alatus (ibid.
figs. 1 &amp; 2).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that some of the Conocoryphid&aelig; have an imperfect facial ridge,
to be compared with the commenced one in Sao <span class="smcap">Barr.</span> I (pl. 7 fig. 9). So the
American Con. trilineata and reticulate. <span class="smcap">Walcott</span> U. S. Geol. Survey 10th Rep. pt. I,
pl. XCV f. 5 &amp; 6. It is, as it were, arrested in the development and these adult trilobites
had stopped, where the larva of Sao was proceeding in its second stage. They are
the forerunners of the blind trilobites with facial suture, belonging to the third group.
It needs scarcely be mentioned that the genera now enumerated have hardly anything
in common, beside the general character of the head, and that real affinity exists
only between Agnostus and Microdiscus, and probably also between Conocoryphe, Ctenocephalus
and Elyx.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beecher</span><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> asserts that there is a suture in Agnostus, but in vain we have
searched for it in numerous well preserved specimens and Dr <span class="smcap">Holm</span> also denies its presence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span>
Nor are there any signs of closed up sutures, which also could not possibly be
expected in so early a stage of evolution. It may then be taken as well settled that a
fundamental character in these the oldest<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of all known trilobites is the total want of a
facial suture and a compactness of the whole head shield which later is broken up in
several parts through the disjunction of the free cheeks. In the Lower Silurian formation
there are a few genera sharing in the same structure of the head shield, though
by no means else related. Such are Dindymene, Areia, Carmon and in the U. Silurian
Cromus. The two species forming <span class="smcap">Barrande's</span> genus Dindymene are so dissimilar
that Dind. Friderici Augusti had better to be removed to a new genus and the first described
one to be retained as type of the genus Dindymene. The same is the case with
Carmon, where the type species C. mutilus is blind and without free cheeks while the
other species, known only by its fixed cheeks and glabella is one of the Olenid&aelig;.</p>

<p class="caption2">II. Blind trilobites with facial ridge.</p>

<p>This large division embraces the second and third groups or, with a few exceptions,
all the rest of the Cambrian trilobites on account of a feature in the cephalic sculpture
common to them all, though widely different as to its first origin in both. What forms
the prominent and common characteristic of these two groups is the presence of the <i>facial
ridge</i>, which emanates from the basis or the front of the foremost segment of the glabella
and in a great variety of different shapes continues backwards near to the posterior border of
the head. It has received several names as <i>eye-line, palpebral lobe, ocular ridge, eye-lobe,
ocular fillet</i> (<span class="smcap">Matthew</span>). In German it is named <i>Augen-leiste</i>, in French <i>filet</i> (<span class="smcap">Barrande</span>)
and in Swedish <i>&ouml;gonlist</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Some authors make a difference between the more narrow
part, calling it eye line, and the thicker posterior node, which they name the palpebral
lobe proper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> That name is the most current amongst the swedish authors, together with &raquo;<i>palpebrallob</i>&raquo;; <span class="smcap">Holm</span>
says <i>&ouml;gonlob</i> and <i>frontallob</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>As this peculiar ridge exists before any facial suture has made its appearance
and separated the head shield in five parts, viz. the median glabellar part, the two fixed
cheeks and the two free cheeks, and as it occurs in genera which never possessed any facial
suture, and where no eye ever was formed, it is not adequate to call it an ocular ridge etc.
the more so, as it, at least during a long series of genera succeeding each other, has had
no connection whatever with any eye. I therefore propose to call it <i>facial ridge</i> (in swedish
<i>faciallist</i>). It occurs on the head of almost all Cambrian trilobites, excepting the
archaic ones, and it is retained in the later Cambrian Peltura, Sph&aelig;rophthalmus etc., which
have real, compound eyes, as well as in a few Lower Silurian genera as Triarthrus, Pliomera,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Euloma, in the Upper Silurian Arethusina and Acidaspis and most persisting in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span>
Harpes, ranging from the Lower Silurian Lower Red Orthoceratite Limestone into the
middle Devonian beds.</p>

<p>It presents itself in the most variable shapes, and as it in fact can be followed through
its development in the oldest known species, it is suitable to begin its description together
with the characteristics peculiar to the oldest or second group in this large subdivision,
that of the <i>Olenellid&aelig;</i>.</p>


<p class="caption3">Group 1. The Olenellid&aelig;.</p>

<p>In this group we have two families of different age, the older, less developed the
Olenellid&aelig; proper, and the younger the Paradoxid&aelig;. The former consists of the genera
Olenellus, Holmia, Mesonacis and Schmidtia, and we shall attend to them first. They
have no facial suture<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and consequently a tripartite head shield like the Archaic
ones, no eyes, but there is that strongly developed and most characteristic facial ridge.
As seen in Olenellus Thompsoni<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the crescent like ridge starts as a direct outflow from
the base of the first segment of the glabella, and is in direct continuation with it as an
integral part. It is roundbacked, regularly curved and at its starting point as broad as one
of the posterior glabellar segments. It is regularly semilunate, tapers posteriorly and ends
near the occipital segment. From the narrow second segment of the glabella, inside the just
described larger ridge, a smaller ridge emanates, broader and flatter than the former, slightly
curved, and ends between the third and fourth glabellar segment. Already in Holmia Kjerulfi
the ridge is modified. There it is only one ridge, the anterior one, nearly as doubled
through a shallow groove running along its back. The second one has dwindled away
so as to be seen only as a narrow stripe near the occipital segment and ending outside
this in a point. The anterior ridge, represented by <span class="smcap">Holm</span> as consisting of two nearly
independent parts, is indeed in one piece, though its dorsal groove sometimes is deep,
and it is with its total breadth joint to the first glabellar segment. Along its outer edge,
where it lies close to the cheek, a narrow slit runs, and I suppose that it is to be considered
as the first indication of the forming of a facial suture, which however does not
reach longer than the ridge. As in Paradoxides it is so tight to the cheek, that there
has been no place for an eye. It is no accidental break, its edges being too regular and
unbroken in all specimens. This ridge is by far much shorter than in Olenellus and
terminates opposite the third segment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> <span class="smcap">Beecher</span> Natural Classification of the Trilobites, p. 191, pretends that in Olenellus and Holmia real
sutures &raquo;in a condition of symphysis&raquo; occur. He seems to deny the facial sutures and to accept as &raquo;real
sutures&raquo; the &raquo;internal sutures&raquo; described by <span class="smcap">Holm</span> in Olenellus Kjerulfi. It is highly doubtful if these interior
elevated lines are to be regarded as sutures. They are indeed no sutures, but in reality elevated linear ridges,
inclosing, as it were, narrow canals. The real sutures known, the facial sutures, never form elevated lines, be
it on the outside of the head or on the inside. Probably these lines are derived from some now unknown interior
organization and it may be fit to remind of the somewhat similar though more numerous linear canals
of the branchi&aelig; on the interior surface of the great head shield of Apus. (<span class="smcap">Zaddach</span> De Apodis cancriformis
Anatome ... pl. II fig. 1) or what <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> (Anatomy Invertebr. Animals p. 281) calls the convoluted &raquo;shell
gland&raquo; in the carapace. A quite different structure is what I suppose to be the incipient facial suture in Holmia.</p>

<p>Already <span class="smcap">Linnarsson</span> observed the second ridge as he tells in a paper where he
describes Olen. Kjerulfi for the first time.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It has been called an &raquo;ornamental&raquo; spine,
but in the following we shall learn what it really is. This ridge in connection with its
spine has not been observed in any other of the Olenellid&aelig;, at least not in their adult stage.</p>

<p>Thanks to the discovery of very early larval stages of the American Olenellus
asaphoides, which <span class="smcap">Ford</span><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and <span class="smcap">Walcott</span><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> have described and figured, we can through
combination of these decipher the development and signification of the facial ridges. To
facilitate my explanation I here join a series of cuts from the earliest stage to the more
developed, with addition of two schematic stages to complete in a certain degree the
series of <span class="smcap">Walcott</span> and <span class="smcap">Ford</span>.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> See figures <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> In his paper on &raquo;The larval stages of Trilobites&raquo; p. 175 <span class="smcap">Beecher</span> gives a new figure (f. 6), original
from <span class="smcap">Ford's</span> collection, of the larva of Ol. asaphoides, but it is so sketchy that I cannot with certainty make
out what it means. I cannot agree with him when he speaks of free cheeks and eyes in these and he is completely
wrong when he says that the outer pair of spines belong to the free cheeks etc. (p. 176).</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="#pg13_f01">figure 1</a> has been hypothetically composed as a deduction from <a href="#pg13_f02">fig. 2</a>, which
presupposes an earlier stage of development like that in <a href="#pg13_f01">fig. 1</a>, when there existed three or
four pair of lateral appendages in the larva. This then consists of a central portion of five
segments. The large anterior crescentlike segment does not, however, show any distinction
between a central part and lateral appendages, it is nearly as large as the three next
taken together and its backwards bent side horns embrace the next two posterior segments
and attain with their narrow pointed tips the back of the fourth segment. The central portion
consists of five segments, when the somewhat not well definite posterior marginal segment
is taken in account. Each of these segments excepting the fifth one has lateral appendages,
those of the second and third segment being quite as broad as the central part and bent
backwards in a curve ending in a small pointed spine. The lateral appendages of the
fourth segment are largest of all, more than double the length of the two next in front,
triangular and standing out beyond the posterior border of the shell as a broad spine.</p>

<p>In <a href="#pg13_f02">fig. 2</a> a great change has set in. There is no distinction between the lateral
appendages of the third and fourth segments at left. These two have been fused together,
they have united, so as to make the left triangular spine look larger than it was
originally. The appendages of the right side are still in the same state as before. But this
fusion of the lateral appendages also takes place in another direction, as shown in another
specimen (<a href="#pg13_f03">fig. 3</a>), so that the second and third appendages on both sides coalesce into one
piece. Now it is easy to imagine that at last a complete fusion has set in between all
lateral appendages and that instead of the original three on each side, there is only one large
piece, reaching beyond the shell as a broad spine, as represented in the hypothetical <a href="#pg13_f04">figure 4</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#pg13_f03">figure 3</a> a progressive change is also seen in the transformation of the first
central segment. From occupying the whole foremost space of the shell it has been lessened
in size, more distantiated from the anterior border of the shell and rounded off, more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
prominent and definite from the lateral appendages, which have become narrow, though of
the same length as before. The two first central segments seem to have been united into one.</p>

<p>Between the hypothetical <a href="#pg13_f04">figure 4</a> and <a href="#pg13_f05">fig. 5</a>, there is evidently a great lacuna,
not yet filled up. In the interval of time the two appendages, which we saw in <a href="#pg13_f04">fig. 4</a>,
have been much modified, the posterior one having lost so much in bulk, and the
anterior being lengthened and stretching out beyond the border of the shell in a
narrow spine alongside the posterior one. The central segmented part has now assumed
a shape, which on comparing it with the following stages of development makes
its true nature evident and that it indeed is what in the adult animal becomes the
glabella. The meaning of the previous stages then also is easily understood. The
central segmental piece in them is the glabella or we may, as <span class="smcap">Bernard</span> already has
done, call it for rhachis and the side appendages for pleura, as this little larva represents
the whole body of the future trilobite, and embodies all its parts <i>in nuce</i>. Through
the great changes which these pleura undergo, it results, as we have seen, that two pair
vanish, being incorporated with the large fourth pair and that only two rest for a while,
the anterior one being the so much renowned frontal-lob or eye lobe and the second one
the so called &raquo;ornamental spine&raquo;, which in fact is a compound of the original second
third and fourth pleura of the corresponding segments.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that this larva, which represents the future trilobite in
its earliest stage, is nothing but the head, or what in the adult takes the place of the
head, and especially its dorsal surface and that it thus solely consists of the future
head.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#pg13_f05">figure 5</a> (<span class="smcap">Ford's</span> fig. 1.) there are the first signs of the pygidium coming
and in the <a href="#pg13_f06">fig. 6</a> it is well developed, but the thorax is still non apparent. In the stage
<a href="#pg13_f06">fig. 6</a> both pleura have increased in length and the compound one also in bulk. They project
with spiny points beside the beginning pygidium and the anterior pleura have united
across the first segment of the glabella through a narrow ridge, which seems to cut that
segment in two. The sequence in the order of development or growth thus is first the
head, then the pygidium and last the thorax. At least it is so in these the oldest of
all trilobites. But in nearly all trilobites of which there are good data, the head is the
part first developed.</p>

<p>Evidently a large hiatus exists between the stages represented in figs. <a href="#pg13_f06">6</a> and <a href="#pg13_f07">7</a>
(<span class="smcap">Ford's</span> figs. 2 &amp; 3, 1877), in the latter of which the animal, though not adult, has had
the thorax and pygidium added to the head. The modifications in the size of the pleura
are the chief changes. The anterior pair is reduced and retired within the posterior border
of the head forming a semilunar arch joined with the occipital ridge in an angular bend.
The posterior pair is enlarged and its spine is by and by reduced (figs. <a href="#pg13_f08">8</a>, <a href="#pg13_f09">9</a>, <a href="#pg13_f10">10</a>) till it
quite disappears and only the wide semicircular field between the first pleuron and the
glabella is left behind as a remnant of its dilated body. It is to be remarked, that
while in the plurality of the adult Olenellid&aelig; all traces of the spiny projections of the
second pleuron have vanished, they are still retained in the adult Holmia Kjerulfi, though
not in the American Holmi&aelig;, and thus give it at the same time a more ancient and a more
larval stamp. The shallow groove along the back of its first pleuron indicates strongly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
its pleural nature, as the thoracic pleura commonly are divided through such grooves.
The same peculiarity is also observable in several of the American Olenellid&aelig;. It is
much the same with the posterior pleuron, the pleural nature of which is revealed through
its spine, that is homologous and identical with the spiny terminations of the thoracic
pleura. We have thus through the remarkable finds of <span class="smcap">Ford</span> and <span class="smcap">Walcott</span> combined
received an explanation of the morphological origin and nature of the facial ridge, the
so called eye lobe and found that it has nothing whatever of the character of a visual
organ. But it must be borne in mind, that these developmental changes are peculiar
only to the Olenellid&aelig;, the origin of the facial ridge in the later trilobites is, as we shall
see, quite a different one.</p>

<p>The Olenellid&aelig; belong chiefly to the oldest of the Cambrian beds with trilobites,
and none of them has as yet been found higher up.</p>

<p>Next in order of evolution we have the important tribe of the Paradoxid&aelig;. These
are preeminently distinguished from the Olenellid&aelig; through the well developed facial
suture, which without exception in them all runs outside the facial ridge and separates
this from the free cheek.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This is a great step forwards in the evolution and establishes
the fact, demonstrable also by other evidence, that the formation of the facial suture is
subsequent to the appearance of the facial ridge. This preexisting ridge seems to have
had no small influence on the development of the suture, it checked its progress from
the front or from the sides toward the fixed cheeks and directed its course against the
genal angles. It lay as a protection for the glabella against this disseverance, causing
the separating line to run along its outside.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> They have thus a quinquepartite cephalic shield, as the later trilobites.</p>

</div>

<p>This group consists of the genus Paradoxides proper, as well as of Centropleura,
Metadoxides and Hydrocephalus, if this is an adult form and not the larva of an unknown
Paradoxides. Perhaps such forms as &raquo;Conocephalites&raquo; Emmrichi <span class="smcap">Barrande</span>, as well
as Anomocare limbatum, An. excavatum, Bathyuriscus and Dolichometopus may on account
of the shape of their facial ridges be considered as related to the Paradoxid&aelig;. But this
must be left for coming researches to decide. Some American Cambrian forms also share
in this characteristic and may upon closer inspection be ranged here. So Zacanthoides.
In these as in the true Paradoxid&aelig; the facial suture follows the ridge along its whole
length, while in the trilobites of the third group the facial suture is in contact only with
the posterior end of the ridge, the so called eye lobe. Remopleurides does not show
characters, that as <span class="smcap">Beecher</span> thinks, could unite it with the Paradoxid&aelig;. These are blind
and Remopleurides has well developed eyes and an organization that gives it an isolated
position in the system.</p>

<p>The facial ridge continues in a great variety of shapes, short or long, but always
forming the fraction of a circle, always of nearly equal thickness, only slightly tapering
towards one of the extremities, and always when in direct connection with the glabella,
starting from the base of its foremost, largest segment. As a rule the ridge is more
developed in the young or larval individuals, continuing from the glabella to near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">-17-</span>
posterior cephalic border in an uninterrupted arch<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> quite as in several of the adult Olenellid&aelig;
of the oldest Cambrian. It can be taken as granted that its origin is the same as
in the Olenellid&aelig; though at present the only evidence at hand is the small larva of Paradoxides
oelandicus, which <span class="smcap">Linnarsson</span> called Parad. aculeatus.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In this we see the anterior
pleuron or the facial ridge alone present, elongated downwards like the same pleuron in
the figure 6 of Olenellus asaphoides and terminating like this in a fine spine stretching
backwards outside the posterior border. Of the second pair of pleura there is nothing
to be seen. This must then have been aborted at an earlier stage than in the
Olenellid&aelig;.</p>

<p>The connexion between the free cheeks and the middle part of the head has been
very lax not only in the Paradoxid&aelig;, but on the whole in nearly all Cambrian trilobites
with free cheeks. When the free cheek is dissevered it shows no trace of the ridge, there
is only a large scallop on the spot where it embraced the ridge. In the Paradoxid&aelig; the
rim of the indenture and the ridge are in so close contact that there is not the least place
for an eye between them, as can be seen in the few specimens with a complete head. In
all oculate trilobites again without any exception the facial suture separates that part of
the eye which is the real visual organ with corneal facets, from the interior often elevated
portion, opposite it, the so called palpebral lobe. The eye is <i>always</i> placed on the free
cheek,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the lobe again always on the fixed cheek of the head shield. No real eye exists
without the palpebral lobe, and, on the other hand, that part of the facial ridge which
later in the development changes to a palpebral lobe, occurs alone without any eye in a
great number of Cambrian trilobites, and consequently these are blind and such is the
case with the Paradoxid&aelig; and a great number of the succeeding.</p>

<p>There is not the least evidence to support the suggestion that the &raquo;ocular ridge&raquo; is
homologous, with the eye of Apus<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and that the real crystal cones lay sunk beneath the
surface in a &raquo;water sac&raquo;. As we, for instance, in Peltura have an &raquo;ocular ridge&raquo; (= facial
ridge <i>mihi</i>) on the fixed cheek and opposite its posterior extremity, the &raquo;eye lobe&raquo;, a
real eye with facets on the free cheek it is not likely to suppose that the &raquo;ocular ridge&raquo;
nor the &raquo;eye lobe&raquo; ever functioned as a visual organ or that two widely different sorts of
eyes were placed in closest vicinity opposite each other.</p>

<p>It may be worth while here to remind of the great similarities, whether analogous
or homologous, in the formation of the superior surface of the head in the trilobites and
the embryons and the newly hatched larva of Limulus. The latter have the head shield
separated into five portions, partly through a facial suture which, as in Peltura, Dalmanites
and others, forms a continuous line around the glabella. This suture divides the
eye node in a similar way as in the trilobites, that is, sectioning it in two parts, of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
one adheres to the central fixed cheeks and the other to the free cheeks.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And to judge
by the figures of <span class="smcap">Kingsley</span> the former, the whitish moiety is the first developed and
sometimes for a while quite alone as the facial ridge of the trilobites and probably also
anterior to the suture, as this is not complete at this stage. This white node reminds
of the small facial ridge in Arionellus ceticephalus <span class="smcap">Barr.</span></p>

limits the outside of the &raquo;lobus palpebralis&raquo; and he makes a clear distinction between
that lobe and the &raquo;tuberculi and eminenti&aelig; oculares&raquo; (= facial ridge) of which he says
that they are the more or less evident elevations situated in the <i>blind</i> Pal&aelig;ades on the
place of the eyes (in which he is wrong) &raquo;and which perhaps are an indication of such
organs&raquo;. But then he says doubtfully (p. 255) &raquo;tuberculorum ocularium veram naturam

<p>Group 2. The Olenid&aelig; and related families.</p>

<p>Next in the ascending order we have the largest group of trilobites in the Cambrian,
of which the greatest part is formed by the Olenid&aelig;. A facial ridge different in
shape and different in development from that in the former group characterizes them.
Unlike the semilunate ridge of the Olenellid&aelig; it issues mostly from the front of the first
segment of the glabella and goes generally backwards till it meets the facial suture. It
is narrow and fine as a thread, but for the rest assumes a great variety of forms. It
may be curved as a circle segment as in Sao, Liostracus, it may be long and straight,
standing out in a right angle to the glabella as in Eurycare, it may be short and straight
in an acute angle to the glabella as in Parabolina and so forth. In the same genus, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
for instance Olenus, straight and curved ridges occur in the various species, and consequently
the form of this sort of ridge cannot be used as a generic character. It moreover
differs from the ridge in the Olenellid&aelig; and the Paradoxid&aelig; in having the posterior
extremity widened as a tubercle or node, which commonly has been called the &raquo;palpebral
lobe&raquo;, while in the older groups the ridge is only at the most a little pointed in both
ends or of equal thickness.</p>

<p>Some persistent archaic genera as Conocoryphe and Elyx inform us how this ridge
has originated and how widely different it is from that in the Olenellid&aelig;. On the surface
of their head shield no ridge is visible, but on the interior side of it we behold, as the
figures show (<a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. VI, figs. 43 &amp; 44</a>) on each side of the glabella a ramifying system as
of the most minute vessels, which spread and cover the whole surface of the cheeks.
This reticulation issues from a main trunk that goes nearly straight in an oblique direction
from the foremost segment of the glabella and emits narrow branches forwards and
backwards on its both sides. And these branches go on dividing till they occupy the
entire interior surface of the fixed cheeks. The figures representing this are taken from
Elyx laticeps <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 43</a>, and an almost similar image has been obtained from a species of
Conocoryphe <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 44</a>.</p>

<p>Now the question may be asked, what does this network of branching canals mean?
I think we cannot gain a more plausible answer than that given us through the inspection
of the soft parts that lie hidden behind the glabella of Limulus and its fixed
cheeks, the only living crustacean which offers the greatest homologies with the head
shield of the trilobites. Next below the shell of the glabella and the cheeks of Limulus
there is a complicated stratum of muscles and behind this the heart and the great central
circulatory system spreading from that centrum towards the sides of the head shield, the
vessels being the more fine and minute, the more they are elongated from the centre.
I now suppose that likewise in these trilobites the narrow and prominent glabella has
been the receptacle not only of a strong mass of muscles, but also for the central part
of the circulation. This centre has there sent out two relatively strong ducts or canals,
one on each side of the glabella feeding all soft tissues inside and near the cheeks and
probably also other important parts of the body. It is also clearly seen in Elyx how
the orifice of the main trunc opens in the hollow of the glabellar apex.</p>

<p>In all crustaceans, as far as is now known, their more or less hard calcareous or chitinous
skeleton is moulded by the subjacent tissues and glands. The sculpture of the surface
consequently is an outcome of the fashioning procedures showing what has been going on
below and what is still going on. If we then on the exterior surface of the head shield of
the trilobites see the radiating lines in relief we must conclude that they are due to a
subjacent system of almost capillary vessels causing hollow impressions on the inside and
elevated ridges exteriorly. In Elyx the vessels have made no strong impression as to be
visible on the outside. In a couple of American Conocoryph&aelig; again (C. reticulata and
C. trilineata) the main trunc of the vessels has formed a short faintly elevated ridge.
In Solenopleura (<a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. VI, f. 45</a>) the facial ridge has been fully developed, and by the casts
of the inside it is clearly seen that the main trunc of the vessels makes the inside of
the ridge and has been much incrassated. On the other hand the smaller branches issuing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
from it have been reduced in size and number, but are still visible. Thus, if I am
right, the two, the facial ridge and the main trunc, are in causal connection and the
former has been moulded by the later, when it had gained in size sufficiently, and when
a richer affluxion of nutritive fluid was directed backwards towards the point where
the eye at last originated. The further changes in this ridge thus are related to the
development of the eye. As far as I am aware, there are as yet no data to tell us
whether the appendages or pleura of the glabella in the larval (or primordial) Olenellid&aelig;
have the same origin as the ridge of the Olenid&aelig; or are homologous with it. Perhaps
it may be so in respect to the foremost one, which also is persisting. It is, however,
not known how the pleura in the olenellid glabella have been developed, whereas it is
well ascertained by the growth of the glabella in Sao, Liostracus and others that such
pleura never have been developed in them.</p>

<p>What the phylogenetic evolution has taught us concerning the formation of the
facial ridge is confirmed by the ontogenetic development of individuals of some species
as for instance Sao hirsuta <span class="smcap">Barr.</span>, Liostracus sp. <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;g.</span> and others.</p>

<p>This development can be followed in detail through the excellent figures of the
larval stages of Sao hirsuta which <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has given in his magnificent work, vol. I,
pl. 7. In the <i>first</i> stage figured (figs. 1 d-e) the whole animal consists only of the
head shield which is completely smooth, the glabella scarcely segmented, no facial ridge,
no facial suture. In the <i>second</i> stage, according to me (figs. 2-4 a), the glabella has
become distinctly segmented, and the pygidium and partly the thorax have been added.
In the <i>third</i> stage, 4 c, d-9, one small narrow string exits from each side of the front
of the glabella, making the first faint beginning of the facial ridge. They form a right
angle with the glabella. In continued growth they become by degrees a little more
curved (figs. 5 c, 6 b) and the lengthened ridge bends parallel to the outer lateral margin
of the head (fig. 9 b). In fig. 9 d it has become so far complete that it reaches nearly
back to the posterior cephalic margin, but is still of the same narrowness all along.
In the <i>fourth</i> stage, in a specimen (fig. 10 a) of 3 mm. in length, the facial suture makes
its first appearance, setting in from the posterior margin of the head and meeting in its
forward progress the posterior extremity of the facial ridge which now begins to swell
out. It seems that both have a mutual influence on each other, the suture being deviated
from a straight course<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> to take a bend outside the ridge, and the extremity of
the ridge again at this contact to increase in size so as to form the elongated tubercle, often
called palpebral lobe (fig. 14 b). This now augments in the same rate as the whole body.
The characters of the four stages of the development of the larva consequently
are: 1:o The archaic stage, only head shield with ridgelike glabella. 2:o The coming and
growth of the pygidium and the complete segmentation of the glabella. 3:o The coming
and growth of the facial ridge. 4:o The coming and development of the facial suture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> In Trinucleus and Ampyx where there is no facial ridge, the suture has a straight direction along
the lateral margins.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barrande</span> regards the whole ridge as a prolongation of the eye and the tubercle
at its posterior extremity as the eye itself.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But, again, in page 399 he says &raquo;Sa surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span>
(of the eye) est toujours mal conserv&eacute;e, pour nous permettre de voir si elle &eacute;tait r&eacute;ticul&eacute;e.&raquo;
And he also confounds the ridge, &raquo;filet&raquo; as he names it, with the eye itself, and
the first faint beginnings of this ridge in his fourth stage he considers as the eye.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> By
a partly schematical figure of the free cheek (fig. 25) he places the eye on this cheek,
and in the same manner in fig. 29, &raquo;restaur&eacute;e d'apr&egrave;s divers fragments&raquo; he figures a
reticulated surface of the eye on the free cheek, outside the tubercle. I have sought for
a reticulated surface on sufficiently good specimens, but never found any, and I must
consider Sao as one of the blind genera. <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> himself also in the table on the
eyes of the trilobites places Sao in the group with &raquo;Surface visuelle inconnue&raquo;, p. 131.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> has also succeeded<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in finding a series of small larva, which he considers
as belonging to a species of Liostracus. As the figures drawn by <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> twenty five years
ago may now be very little known, I here reproduce them with the kind permission of
the Editors of &raquo;Geologiska F&ouml;reningens F&ouml;rhandlingar&raquo;, where they were published in 1875.
This development proceeds nearly upon the same plan as in Sao. The first stage, however,
(I) seems to be much earlier than any of Sao, the rhachis or glabella consisting of an unsegmented
ridge of more primitive appearance. Before this first stage of <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger's</span> larva a still
older phase of development can be imagined, (0) a simple rounded, smooth head shield
without any indication of a glabella at all. This stage might correspond to the head of
certain species of Agnostus, as A. glandiformis, A. nudus, which have no glabella. This
stage 0 is also valid for the larva of Sao. Several stages are evidently wanting between I
and II, in the later of which the thickened glabella is divided in four segments. In III we
have six segments, all these three stages consisting only of the ovate head with
narrow fixed cheeks. In IV the pygidium has been added to the primitive head, but the
segments of the glabella have been reduced to four and in V slightly altered in shape
In VI, again, we see the head with five glabellar segments and scarcely the first sign of
the facial ridge. Between VI and VII there must be links missing, as the change can not
be so abrupt, and likewise between VIII and IX as in VIII there are still no free cheeks
nor any facial ridge. This interesting discovery of <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> confirms, together with those of
several other authors<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, the supposition that the development of the later Cambrian and
older Silurian forms is a quite different one from that of the Olenellid&aelig; and the Paradoxid&aelig;.
They have a rhachis, but no pleura proper, as the single facial ridge has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span>
quite different signification and appears at a comparatively much later stage than the
facial ridge of the Olenellid&aelig;, which is present from the earliest stages known.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This form of facial ridge, although prevalent in the middle and later Cambrian
times, dates back so far that genera coeval with Holmia, viz. Ellipsocephalus and Arionellus
show it along the facial suture. This early occurrence of the ridge coeval with
the less developed Olenellid&aelig; leads to the assumption of a different origin of these trilobites
as a branch, which already far back in the oldest Cambrian or precambrian times
had deviated from a common ancestor and I have tried to give a view in tables of these
two coordinated lines of evolution further on, at pages 24 and 25. The most remarkable
genera which, as far as I have found, belong to this fourth group are Ellipsocephalus,
Arionellus, Liostracus, Olenus, Leptoplastus, Parabolina, Corynexochus, Parabolinella, Sao,
Ptychoparia, Doropyge, Oryctocephalus etc.</p>

<p>I have not been able with an absolute degree of certainty to recognize whether
some of these genera now enumerated, have been oculate or blind like Sao, like the Paradoxid&aelig;
and similar. The precarious state of preservation prevents all definite conclusions
in that respect. It seems, however, that the evidence gathered through the examination
of numerous specimens rather points in a negative direction. As the free cheeks
in these old Cambrian trilobites have been in a very loose connection with the fixed
cheeks and generally deciduous, contrary to the condition in the Silurian ones, it is in
many instances very difficult to tell whether species with facial ridge, especially those
from the earlier Olenus schists have been blind or provided with eyes.</p>

<p>The order of succession of the genera in the Swedish uppermost Cambrian, in the
Olenid slates is, according to <span class="smcap">S. A. Tullberg's</span> researches<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> at Andrarum in Scania as
follows:</p>

<p>
1. Parabolina (oldest division of the Olenus slates).<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Olenus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Liostracus.</span><br />
2. Eurycare.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Leptoplastus.</span><br />
3. Peltura.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sph&aelig;rophthalmus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ctenopyge.</span><br />
4. Cyclognathus (uppermost).<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Acerocare.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Om Agnostusarterna vid Andrarum.</p>

</div>

<p>It is already in the second division that we find the earliest oculate genus in Eurycare
and in the higher strata. Sph&aelig;rophthalmus and Ctenopyge with enormous hemispherical
eye balls, while Olenus and Parabolina, their earliest predecessors, probably were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">-23-</span>
blind. We have not amongst hundreds of specimens of these genera found a single specimen
showing an ocular globe covered with facets. Olenus and the nearly related genus
Parabolina are found in innumerable specimens in the thinly laminated alumschists of
Scania and other provinces of Sweden. But rarely a perfect head shield, or nearly so,
is to be found with the free cheeks in place. If so, the semicircular scallop in the free
cheek is entirely filled up by the posterior lobe of the facial ridge and there is no place
left for any eye.&mdash;If we, again, find a non compressed glabella and fixed cheeks likewise,
the facial lobe (-&raquo;eye-lobe&raquo;) is in some elevated so much as to leave a little space between it
and the scallop of the free cheek, which space must have been an empty lacuna if not
filled up by an eye ball. But it may also be that the free cheek has been somewhat put out
of its order and that consequently some space has been left between it and the free cheek.
It is quite as much with older genera, as Solenopleura especially, in which the posterior
lobe of the facial ridge (<i>vulgo</i> &raquo;eye lobe&raquo;) has attained a great development, and in which
one just could expect to find a sph&aelig;rical eye resting between the elevated lobe and the
scallop. The elevated rim of this scallop does not in fact constitute a proof for its having
clasped an eye as the elevated scallop in Sph&aelig;rophthalmus did. In Paradoxides, again, in
Ellipsocephalus, where there is absolutely no trace of an eye ever having been present,
whenever you succeed to find the free cheek in juxtaposition with the fixed cheek it
is evident that the elevation of the scallop rim is due to the impact of the posterior
lobe of the facial ridge. In many specimens of Dolichometopus and Corynexochus etc.
no free cheeks have ever been found and to judge by the shape of the facial ridge it
may be concluded that these also were deprived of eyes.</p>

<p>On seeing this great number of trilobites, that on account of their organization
must be considered as blind, the first suggestion that strikes the mind, is that they must
have lived in abyssal depths of the Cambrian sea, where the most intensive darkness prevailed.
Nor does the nature of the strata contradict such an assumption as evidently
this fine sediment must have been deposited far beyond the reach of the influence of the
wave motion, a depth amounting to more than a thousand metres as now calculated, for
else it could not have preserved unbroken such delicate parts of organisms as that free cheek
of Ctenopyge pecten with its extraordinary long and delicate horn, figured on plate III fig.
27 and many others. But it seems incredible that such a state of things should have
prevailed during the deposition of all the Cambrian strata, although they in Sweden
amount to only 160 feet in thickness, according to the evaluation of <span class="smcap">S. A. Tullberg</span>,
not considering what has been lost through denudation. The length and duration in
time can in this instance not be measured by the thickness of the beds, but by the great
changes in the faunas which there have succeeded one another. The physical conditions,
to judge by the composition of the rocks, seem in the main to have lasted during immeasurable
periods and still the fauna has changed in no little degree. During that enormous
length of time, embracing in Sweden eight well separated periods, there must, however,
have been minor changes in the conditions of depth and consequently in the nature
of the depositions. To a certain extent the physical agents must have influenced the
organization of the animals, but not essentially. There are sure evidences of another
factor being the chief agent and that is the evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span></p>

<p>We have from the lowest Olenellus beds to the lowest Lower Silurian strata followed
the clear traces of the changes from the eyeless Olenellid&aelig; past the Paradoxid&aelig;
with the facial suture to the great tribe of the Olenid&aelig; in which the facial ridge with
its lobe is so prominent, and to the oculate genera at the top of the formation.</p>

<p>As stated above there seems to be evidence enough for accepting two different lines
of evolution in these the oldest trilobites. For the oldest, Olenellus is the type and for
the second Sao may be taken as the representative.</p>

<p>These two evolutional lines could be represented with their phases in chronological
succession as follows:</p>


<h3>A. <b>The Olenellus line.</b></h3>

<p>1. The trilobite consisting only of the head with rhachis and pleur&aelig;, no sutures,
no ridge, no eyes. Adult forms precambrian. Corresponding larval forms (Olenellus
asaphoides) in the Lowest Cambrian. Still older and simpler forms may be presupposed
as preceding these.</p>

<p>2. Semilunate facial ridge on the tripartite head-shield, no sutures, no eyes, but
a hypostoma fused to the rostrum of the head and provided with macul&aelig;. The adult
animal with thorax and pygidium in the oldest Cambrium, the Olenellus zone. Genera:
Olenellus, Holmia (with beginning suture), Mesonacis, Schmidtia.</p>

<p>3. The head quinquepartite with facial suture, short semilunate ridge in the adult,
a long ridge in the young, no eyes. The genera occur in the Paradoxides-zones of
the Cambrian formation. These genera are Paradoxides, Centropleura, Metadoxides,
Hydrocephalus, which are direct descendants of the Olenellid&aelig;.</p>

<p>This line of evolution, in which the species never acquired eyes, was extinct in
the sixth zone of the Swedish Cambrian, Centropleura Lov&eacute;ni being the last.</p>


<h3>B. <b>The Sao line.</b></h3>

<p>I call this so because we see in the development of Sao, as represented by <span class="smcap">Barrande</span>,
most of the different' phases in evolution, which the ridge bearing trilobites of
this second group have experienced during the Cambrian times.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The body consists only of the head, neither pygidium, nor thorax yet developed.</p>

<p>1. <i>Psilocephali</i> (&#968;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#962;, bald), primeval, precambrian, adult stage not found, supposed
to be like the head shield of Agnostus glandiformis and A. biplicatus quite round and bare
without any glabella nor sutures. The corresponding stage in development also wanted.</p>

<p>2. <i>Glabellate.</i> The entire animal only head with a mesial ridge, which at first
is entire or unsegmented and later is metamorphosed into the segmented glabella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span></p>

<p>a. <i>unsegmented.</i>, Precambrian, adult form unknown, supposed to be like the first
larval stage of Liostracus according to the figure I of <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> and also as the head of
Agnostus parvifrons <span class="smcap">Linnarsson</span>. Corresponding larval stages Liostracus (I).</p>

<p>b. <i>segmented.</i> Probably precambrian, not represented as adult in the Cambrian
strata. Supposed to be like the larval forms II and III of <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger's</span> Liostracus, consisting
of the round or oval head shield and the segmented glabella. Also <span class="smcap">Barrande's</span>
first stage of Sao (<span class="smcap">Barr.</span>, fig. 1 pl. 7).</p>

<p>As a transition to the next phase forms may be imagined having head and the
beginning pygidium, nearly as Agnostus atavus, minus the thorax. The corresponding
larval stages are Liostracus (<span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger's</span> figures IV, V, VI) and Sao (<span class="smcap">Barrande</span>, pl. 7 fig.
2-4 a, b). Nearly so, though the pygidium is more developed, are the larva of Agn.
bibullatus and Agn. nudus (<span class="smcap">Barr.</span>, pl. 49) both without thorax.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>These have the three chief parts of the body developed.</p>

<p>3. <i>The facial ridge.</i> Cambrian, adult with glabella and facial ridges, short or long,
emanating from the top of the glabella, thorax and pygidium. Several American Conocoryph&aelig;.
Corresponding larval stage, Sao, stage 3, <span class="smcap">Barr.</span> pl. 7 figs 4 d-9.</p>

<p>4. <i>Suture.</i> A suture dividing the fixed cheeks in two pair viz. two fixed cheeks
and two free cheeks. Fully developed facial ridge. Oldest known adult forms are Ellipsocephalus,
Arionellus, already in the Lowest Cambrian, the Olenellus beds, what presupposes
a long, antecedent lineage far back in the precambrian times. Corresponding larval stage
in Sao, <span class="smcap">Barr.</span> pl. 7 figs 10-13. The plurality of Cambrian trilobites belong here.
An intermediate stage leading to the next is seen in such forms in which the
ridge posteriorly is widened into the &raquo;eye lobe&raquo;, which rests in the scallop of the free
cheek. So it is in Liostracus and many others besides. Solenopleura possibly oculate.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>5. Globular eyes. Cambrian, in the youngest zone, the Olenus schists. The oldest
at present known oculate trilobite Eurycare is found in the second division of these schists.</p>

<p>In the lowest Lower Silurian division, the Ceratopyge limestone, Euloma and Ceratopyge
occur as the last survivors of the blind, partially ridge bearing genera. The
Trinucleid&aelig; and Ampyx belong to another group of trilobites.</p>

<p>Even among other exclusively Lower Silurian genera, in which the plurality of the
species is oculate, there are species entirely blind. So with Ill&aelig;nus, in which genus Dr
<span class="smcap">Holm</span> has not found any eye in Ill. Angelini, I. leptopleura and Ill. c&aelig;cus. The free
cheek in these three species is much narrow, as the facial suture lies near the margin
of the head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_eyes_of_the_Trilobites"><b>The eyes of the Trilobites.</b></h2>
</div>


<p>If, as is probable, to judge by the conformity of their cornea with that of recent
crustacea, the trilobites like these were provided with crystalline cones beneath the corneal
lenses or facets, only the latter have been preserved in a fossil state. Although the crystalline
cones in consequence of their solid consistence might have been petrified as well
as the cornea, they must, imbedded as these tiny cones lie, entirely wrapped up in delicate
tissues, fall away and be lost, when the dissolution of the dead body had set in.
Consequently the curious appendages on the inferior side of the lenses in Dalmanites
vulgaris (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III f. 50</a>) or Phacops quadrilineata (<a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V fig. 38</a>) can noways be considered
as belonging to the original structure of the eye, apart from their great dissimilarity
with anything appertaining to the eyes of the Arthropoda. The cornea on the contrary
cohered with the integument of the body, and it has been well preserved in a great number
of trilobites.</p>

<p>I subdivide the trilobites in respect to the form of their eyes in the following

<p>Only a few authors have before now occupied themselves with the intimate structure
of the trilobite eye. <span class="smcap">Packard</span> gave in 1880, in the &raquo;American Naturalist&raquo; a note on the
structure of the eye of trilobites (p. 503). There are some rough and inexact sketches of the
eyes of Limulus and Asaphus, and although he seems to have known the beautiful researches
of <span class="smcap">Grenacher</span> he still &raquo;claims that the trilobite eye was organized on the same plan as
Limulus&raquo;. This statement is altogether wrong, and as I hope to show the trilobites have
had eyes entirely different from that of Limulus and instead agreeing with those of the
Isopoda and perhaps also with a few other Crustacea. In 1889 <span class="smcap">J. M. Clarke</span> published
an account<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> on the &raquo;Structure and development of the visual area in the trilobite Phacops
rana <span class="smcap">Green</span>&raquo;. The aggregate eye described by him are of the type forming my
third group. His holochroal division embraces my first and second groups and the schizochroal
my third.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Quart. Journ. of Morphology, vol. II p. 253.</p>

</div>

<p>The latest contribution to the knowledge of these eyes is found in <span class="smcap">Exner's</span> &raquo;Physiologie
der facettirten Augen von Krebsen and Insecten&raquo;, 1891, where he gives good
figures of the lenses of Phacops fecundus, pl. II figs 18, 19. He says that the palpable
difference in the structure of these eyes and those of Limulus point to a change in the
function of these eyes.</p>


<h2>I. <b>Compound eyes.</b></h2>

<h3><b>1. Eyes with prismatic, plano-convex lenses.</b></h3>

<p>A pellucid, smooth and glossy integument, a direct continuation of the common
test of the body covers the corneal lenses, quite as is the case in so many of the recent
crustacea. In the plurality it is, however, difficult to discern the lenses from the outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">-28-</span></p>

<p>The lenses, as seen in a vertical section of the eye of Asaphus expansus, (<a href="#Plate_I">pl. I
fig. 12</a>), are columnar prisms, like the pillars of basalt, attaining a length of 0,2 mm
and at the point where the eye joins the test of 0,3 mm. At their interior extremity
they have a breadth of 0,066 mm. On that point the surface is convex and at the exterior
surface plane. They are closely packed and in a transverse section resemble a
pavement of regular hexaeders. But they also assume other shapes and become rhombs
or even quadrates, as seen in a specimen of Asaphus fallax (<a href="#Plate_I">pl. I fig. 18</a>), where the
hexaeders and quadrates lie side by side without transitional forms. As a rule the lenses
become more and more irregular in the vicinity of the surrounding frame or near the
suture, nearly blotted out, as it were, and without any definite border line mingled with
the confused, spongy mass that like a belt or a frame surrounds they eye in Asaphus
and is sharply limited from the other part of the free cheek. This remarkable zone
which is almost only present amongst the Asaphid&aelig; (Asaphus, Megalaspis, Ptychopyge,
Isotelus) retains in a confused manner somewhat of the prismatic structure of the eye
as shown in the section (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I, fig. 11, b</a>). The eye of Bumastus also is environed by
a similar zone, with a structure like that of the eye (<a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II fig 35, 41</a>).</p>

<p>In an undetermined species of Asaphus the lenses, although somewhat apart, are
of an elongated hexaedric outline, which passes into a regular circular one farther away
and on the surface of the eye they are slightly convex (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I figs 27-29</a>). In other
genera belonging to this group the shape of the lenses are like those of Asaphus, so for
instance in Ill&aelig;nus (I. chiron and I. Esmarki) and in Niobe. In Dysplanus centrotus
they are shorter and broad, and their interior or lower surface strongly convex. It is
likewise so in Nileus, where Nileus armadillo has an exceedingly thick exterior integument
above the lenses. Such an integument has in a still higher degree increased in
Bumastus sulcatus so as to exceed in thickness the stratum of the corneal prisms and
it may in fact be doubted if the eyes of this species ever were able to function as visual
organs. Proetus nearly resembles Bumastus in the thickness of the integument covering
the prismatic lenses, which are interiorly convex, with a diameter of 0,03 mm.</p>

<p>In all genera belonging to this group a horizontal section gives the image of the
hexaeders as in Asaphus with some change to squares or rhombs.</p>

<p>In scrutinizing a horizontal, somewhat extensive section of an eye in this group of
trilobites, it will be perceived, as for instance in the figures (<a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V fig. 16, 22</a>) that the
regular and evidently homogenous and intact prismatic lenses by and by have been altered
and in a part of the section, a little distant from the intact ones disintegrated in
their interior, showing various aspects of alteration. I cannot but think that this is a
destruction which has set in long after the fossilization. It has revealed certain states
of the intimate structure, certain delicate details, that now with an astonishing regularity
come in sight and probably also lie hidden in the intact prisms. In the specimens of
Asaphus, which we have studied, the alteration has taken the shape of a concentric stratification
forming the body of the prisms, which is well discernible in a horizontal section,
but not easy to detect in the longitudinal one (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I figs 9-10, 11</a>). It is likewise
so in Niobe. In the other genera again the decomposition makes the prisms look like empty
tubes in which a few irregular traverses and trabecular remains of their solid mass radiate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">-29-</span>
towards the interior. They thus assume the aspect of a composite coral with its septa in
the calicles (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI fig. 31</a>). This is also evident in Nileus palpebrosus and Dysplanus.</p>

<h3><b>2. Eyes with biconvex lenses.</b></h3>

<p>The surface of the eye is, as in Chirurus glaber <span class="smcap">Ang.</span>, a mass of contiguous hemispherical
lenses, probably once covered with a membrane, as is still to be seen in well preserved
specimens of Bronteus laticauda. Both in Chirurus and Bronteus the lenses seen vertically
are globular and ordinated beside each other either continuous or separated only through
a faint dividing line. In a horizontal section passing right through the point of contact
they show the common hexaedral shape and when somewhat corroded the interior radiate
structure also comes forth, the radii directed towards a little black point in the centre.
The lenses of the Brontei have the same stellate structure as in Bumastus (<a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II fig.
7</a>). In Cyrtometopus the lenses are in size the fourth of those in Chirurus and they
form an extremely thin stratum in strongest contrast with the adjoining cheek, which
surpasses them more than six times in thickness (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III fig. 19</a>). The lenses of Cyrtometopus
are more flattened and irregular than in the former genera. The free cheek
around the eyes does not form a border zone, somewhat imitating the eye structure as
in Asaphus, but is more compact, composed of vertical elements which give to the test
of the trilobites in general a tendency to split up in vertical prisms.</p>

<p>Of a peculiar interest are the eyes in the oldest of all oculate trilobites, at present
with certainty known, Eurycare, Peltura, Sph&aelig;rophthalmus and Ctenopyge.</p>

<p>Of these genera Eurycare is the oldest (see table <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>). Amongst the many free
and detached cheeks only a single, very little one has been found with the eye ball fixed.
It seems to be of the same structure as in Sph&aelig;rophthalmus. In Sph&aelig;rophthalmus and
Ctenopyge the eye globes are enormous, considering the size of the cheek in which they
are set and occupy more than a third of the length of the free cheek (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III f. 26, 31</a>).
They are hemispheric, blackish and glossy, more so in the former genus. The spheroidal
lenses, projecting on the surface, are in Ctenopyge larger near the facial suture and small
at the opposite side where the eye is fixed in the free cheek. For the rest, in both genera
(<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III fig. 34</a>) the lenses form a thin stratum, where they in a vertical section lie
elongated, flattened and biconvex, slightly joined with each other at the point of contact.
The fine form which they exhibit reminds of the lenses of Sph&aelig;roma.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> They are in diameter
thrice as long as they are high. Seen in a horizontal section passing through the
point of contact they show hexaeders with a curiously jagged outline (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III fig. 33</a>).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> <span class="smcap">Bellonci</span> Atti dei Lincei. Memorie, vol. X, 1881, Sph&aelig;roma, pl. II fig. 11.</p>

</div>

<p>Peltura which is coeval with these, has a narrow semiglobose visual field (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs
35-41</a>), the superior surface of which is quite smooth and evenly rounded. On its interior
side there stand out, somewhat distantiated, in a low relief semiglobular facets, quite
as regular incrassations of the cornea, thus not forming free lenses, but rather reminding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span>
of the for the rest differently formed quasi-lenses of Limulus. In a vertical section they
appear as the inferior moiety of real ovate lenses (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III f. 40-41</a>).</p>

<p>The much younger Acerocare has a similar cornea. A very little specimen, the
head of scarcely more than one millim. in length, retains both eyes, of which one shows
the slightly convex lenses and the other a cast of the interior side as in Peltura. These
both genera should in consequence of their peculiar limuloid cornea be ranged for themselves
apart from the real lenticulate genera, but any material sufficient for doing this
properly, is at present not at hand.</p>


<h2>II. <b>Aggregate eyes.</b></h2>

<p>These are found solely in the family of the Phacopid&aelig;, unless the Lichadid&aelig; were
also provided with this sort of eyes, but we have had no opportunity to study them.
It seems, however, not likely that they had aggregate eyes. <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has represented them
quite as finely reticulate as the eves of any Asaphid. We have sectioned and figured the
eyes of Dalmanites vulgaris and D. obtusus from the Silurian of Gotland and found that
these have truly aggregate eyes, each consisting of a regular biconvex lens, lying
enclosed in a socket of its own and covered by a cornea of its own. The distance between
the eyes is much variable and in a few instances they are nearly contiguous. Extremes are
seen on <a href="#Plate_III">pl. III figures 43, 47</a>. The lenses are comparatively large, and have always had
a covering membrane, though this in many instances has been lost. This membrane which
is an immediate continuation of the general integument of the body covers the lenses all
round their superior moiety. In its prolongation downwards between the lenses (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI
fig. 3, 4</a>) it is free from the contact with them and hangs alongside and around
much incrassated, so as to take in a section a lengthened lancet like shape. It lies
thus alongside the other interstitial test, and is like this perforated by longitudinal canals.
In a horizontal section taken a little below the surface it encircles the lens as a
wall like ring (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI fig. 1, 2</a>). In a vertical section the lenses lie in direct contact
with the cheek without any intervening zone and the cheek has the structure so common
amongst the trilobites, being perforated by vertical tubes going straight down from the
surface (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III fig. 44</a>, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI f. 5</a>).</p>

<p>In Dalm. vulgaris and also in Phacops quadrilineata there is as already before mentioned
a peculiar structure beneath the lenses, consisting of narrow, threadlike, straight
lines, twice as long as the lenses (<a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III 49-50</a>, <a href="#Plate_V">pl. V fig. 38</a>). In a horizontal section
they are found to be irregular prisms closely packed. It can not be any structure peculiar
to the eyes or the lenses, rather some parasitic growth added since the death of the
animal. The lenses are in several specimens composed of clear calcareous spar. In others
again they have been filled with a dark muddy calcareous rock excepting in the lower
moiety where there is left a residue of the white spar, having in all lenses assumed a
regular shape which I consider as organic (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI fig. 5</a>). This spar covers the whole
bottom and its upper rim is incrassated and bent inwards. In horizontal sections
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">-31-</span>
this residue is a whitish ring close inside the interior ring wall (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI f. 2</a>). I would suggest
that this curious conformation is due to the original structure of the lens, supposing that
it in these crustaceans has been built upon the same plan as in several other Arthropoda.
In Cymothoa<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and in Sph&aelig;roma<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> for instance the lenses are built up of thin
strata, which are parallel with the convex outside, so that on the inferior surface of the lens
they are arched downwards and on the superior side upwards, being not strictly concentric.
In the spiders they are constructed upon this same plan<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> perhaps more evidently.
If now in Phacops the lens consisted of such semiconcentric strata and the upper
moiety has been destroyed, the rest must have taken the shape as we find it. It is
moreover peculiar that the destruction has been exactly similar in all lenses of that
specimen. Can it be due to the circumstance that the power of resistance in the inferior
strata has been greater?</p>

<p>In Phacops quadrilineata the lenses are more elliptic than in the former. On their
interior surface beneath the spiny tufts mentioned large hexaedral prisms of clear calcareous
spar issue, one prism for each lens (<a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V fig. 38</a>), having thus a very deceptive appearance,
but no doubt of inorganic origin with the lenses as a basis for their crystallization,
quite as in the Cystoids where the interior often is converted into a mass of crystalline
prisms, issuing from the interior surface of the plates.</p>


<h2>III. <b>Genera with stemmata and ocelli.</b></h2>

<p>In a little group that has retained larval or ancestral characters during a great part of
the pal&aelig;ozoic period, the genus Harpes stands as a type. It has ranged from the oldest
Lower Silurian, if we join the related Harpides, to the middle Devonian. From near
the top of the glabella, though not so much forward as the facial ridge of the blind
trilobites (Olenus, Liostracus etc.) a straight ridge of much varying length stands out
on both sides and at its extremity two or three globular stemmata with glossy surface
lie encased. Probably this ridge has the same origin as in the Olenid&aelig;, the more so, as
there are indications of an extensive circulatory system. On <a href="#Plate_IV">plate IV fig. 18-19</a> the
right hand ocelli of Harpes vittatus <span class="smcap">Barr.</span> from Lochkow, Bohemia, are represented. They
are two, lying isolated near each other, quite globular with circular outline, smooth and
glossy as to exhibit a shining surface. Their size is 0,4 mm in diameter. Being cut
vertically in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the head they resemble elongated
hemispheres, convex on the exterior surface, slightly concave on the interior. The test
of the head lies between them as a saddle and covers them only partially and on the
outer sides they lie with their margins encased in the head shield. Seen in thin sections
of the right lens and magnified the whitish mass is traversed by vertical, blacker streaks,
standing somewhat radiating towards the sides and cancellate. The other lens has a horizontal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span>
row of black dots. All this is probably not of any structural value, only due to
later changes.</p>

<p>The remarkable genus Harpides from the lowest Lower Silurian belongs also to
this group and has beside the fixed peduncle a peculiar elongated ridge going from the
eyes to the lateral margins of the head<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, a ridge which is also present in some of the
true Harpes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Harpides breviceps cannot belong to this genus and is rather related to Erinnys <span class="smcap">Salter</span>, as also
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> holds it.</p>

</div>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Beecher</span> has shown<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the larva of Trinucleus possesses quite the same transverse
ridge with intumescent eyelike extremities, and although the smallness of the specimens
has not permitted to ascertain the presence of a true eye, it may be apposite to
suppose it on the homology with the eyes of Harpes, a genus with which Trinucleus is
related. But as well known, in the adult Trinuclei there is no trace of these ocular
ridges nor of real eyes so that <span class="smcap">Beecher</span> in his paper &raquo;Blind Trilobites&raquo;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> numerates Trinucleus
amongst these. Out of the nine Scandinavian species of Trinucleus no less than seven
have a well marked little tubercle on each side of the glabella placed exactly on the same
spot where the larval Trinuclei had their much larger eyes placed. In this case it may
be allowed to suppose that the tubercles are the direct successors of the larval eye and
that they are true ocelli. <span class="smcap">Reede</span> seems to be willing to regard them as possessing a
visual function.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> <span class="smcap">Beecher</span><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> holds the eye nodules in the larva and the ocelli in the adult
to be identical.</p>

</div>

<p>But, as <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has shown,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> there is a certain species of Trinucleus, the larva of
which wants a facial ridge and eyes, as there also are several adult forms without ocelli.
These have remained on a much ancestral stage, while the larva with eyes are more
highly developed in such species, where the adult have been subject to a retrograde development.
Ampyx and Dionide, though completely blind, evidently belong to this group,
and once, as is to be hoped, larval forms may be discovered showing their development.
In a certain way Arethusina shows characters proper for this group, in having the straight
ocular ridge, quite as in Harpes, but eyes of the reticulate type and probably prismatic.
It thus like Harpes conserved an ancestral characteristic long periods since it had disappeared
in most of the other genera.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the groups, in which <span class="smcap">Joh:s M&uuml;ller</span><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> long ago classified the Crustacean eyes, his
second &raquo;Hauptgruppe&raquo; (&raquo;Aggregate von einfachen linsenhaften Augen&raquo;) and the fourth &raquo;zusammengesetzten
Augen ... facettirte Hornhaut&raquo; the former corresponds with my third and the
latter with my two first divisions. In so far as the cornea and its facets or lenses are to be regarded,
there is the greatest analogy with the Isopoda. In vertical sections of Sph&aelig;roma we
have the same sort of elongated, flattened biconvex lenses as in Sph&aelig;rophthalmus and others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span>
Since <span class="smcap">Grenacher</span> and <span class="smcap">Exner</span> and others have published their excellent works on the eyes of
the Arthropoda, there can be no foundation for speaking of the resemblance of the trilobitic
eye with that of Limulus, as this genus stands completely isolated amongst all Arthropoda
in that respect. There is, as stated above, a certain resemblance between the cornea of
Peltura and that of Limulus, but this is not yet ripe for a discussion. Nor is there any
evidence for correlating the eyes of the trilobites with the eyes of the Phyllopoda. <span class="smcap">Bernard</span>
thinks that the so called eye of the Paradoxid&aelig; has been formed upon the same
plan as that of Apus. There is nothing to prove this hypothesis that the facial ridge
or any part of it ever had been a visual organ, and the evidence at hand rather tends
in a contrary direction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> In Merkels Archiv 1829 p. 46 and in Treviranus Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Physiologie Bd IV p. 97.</p>

</div>

<p>There are signs of long physiological and anatomical efforts to prepare the development
of the eyes on the free cheek, as revealed through the long series of blind trilobites.
A system of radiating blood vessels, similar to those described above as covering
the inside of the head in some older genera, all issuing from the scallop in the free
cheek, where later the eye had to find its place, have left their stamp, their mark on
the surface of the free cheek. They attest the great vital activity which was so intense
at the point were the eye was to be formed. We give the figures of two such cheeks
of different types. One from Parabolina spinulosa (<a href="#Plate_V">pl. V fig. 31</a>) is the more common,
where six or more isolated trunks radiate from the semilunar ridge round the indenture
and subdivide in branchlets which cease near the lateral margin of the cheek. It may
be that it is an annular vessel near the indenture that feeds them all and that this probably
is in connection with the great central circulatory system. In Olenus (<a href="#Plate_V">pl. V fig.
29</a>) the vessels are partly anastomosing and form a reticulate system and they are studded
with minute wartlets. Another sign, which may be taken as a preparation, is the elevated
rim around the scallop, which is so prominent in several of the Cambrian genera,
but which does not embrace any facet bearing cornea..</p>

<p>From what has been stated above the following conclusions have been arrived at.</p>

<p>1. The plurality of the genera living during the Cambrian period were blind and
it was first at the close of that period, in the Olenus schists, that genera with real visual
organs appeared. There may have been oculate trilobites earlier, as Solenopleura, but we
know nothing of their eyes.</p>

<p>2. The primordial glabellar pleuron which was metamorphosed into a facial ridge
is no visual organ. It is in the Olenid&aelig; nothing but the elevated line made in the test
by the subjacent main trunk of the circulatory system. It swells out in a node, &raquo;palpebral
lobe&raquo;, but not before the facial suture has been formed. In the genera where there
is no facial suture, there is no node. In the Paradoxid&aelig; where the ridge is of a different
origin, there is no node, though there is a suture.</p>

<p>The four types of eyes in the trilobites have probably succeeded one another in
the following chronological order:</p>

<p>1) with stemmata or ocelli; 2) biconvex or lentiform; 3) prismatic; 4) aggregate.
The oldest known representatives for each type are for 1) Harpides rugosus in the Ceratopyge
limestone of the Lower Silur., for 2) Eurycare, in the Cambrian Olenid schists,
division 2, for 3) Megalaspis, in the Ceratopyge limestone of the Lower Silurian, for 4)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">-34-</span>
Phacops in the Lower gray Orthoceratite limestone. The eyes of the trilobites show the
greatest conformity with those of the recent Isopoda.</p>

<p>The most perfect eyes amongst all the trilobitic eyes may be those of the Phacopid&aelig;,
which are also geologically the youngest, the least developed again those of the
Proetid&aelig; or rather of the Bumasti. The great thickness of the cornea in these must
have weakened their power of vision and they had probably only a faint perception of light.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="On_the_macul_of_the_hypostoma"><b>On the macul&aelig; of the hypostoma.</b></h2>
</div>


<p>We shall now turn our attention to the visual organs which <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> discovered
on the hypostoma of Bronteus. In doing this, we may bear in mind, that the genera in
which we really have found lenses on the macul&aelig; are relatively few, but that we shall
review the macul&aelig; in all genera, which we have been able to examine, and try to show
that even most of these may, although in an inferior degree, have acted as visual
organs. At the same time some more details shall be given about the cephalic eyes for
comparing them with the hypostomic ones.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Acidaspis</b> <span class="smcap">Murch.</span></p>

<p>The hypostoma is of a peculiar type, deviating from that of the other genera,
squarish or rectangularly transverse, entirely without terrace lines and no macul&aelig; proper.
<span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has given no less than nine different samples of these hypostomas.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Acidaspis crenata</b> <span class="smcap">Emmr.</span></p>

<p class="tdc">(<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I figs 1-6.</a>)</p>

<p>There are certainly no macul&aelig; of the same sort as in so many other trilobites and
the interior side of the hypostoma does not bear the least traces of impressions which
might be taken as the reverse of the macul&aelig; and still more less as muscular impressions.
In fact, the total absence of such in Acidaspis militates against the interpretation of the
macula impressions as muscular scars. When the macul&aelig; fail, also the so called muscular
impressions fail. Moreover we are able to see still clearer in this matter through
what we know about the structure and position of the extremely similar hypostoma of Apus,
of which we have given a description in the end of this memoir. This skeletal part of
Apus is without any connection with the surroundings, excepting at its anterior margin, and
is consequently movable in a direction outwards and upwards. Along that anterior margin
it is fixed to the outside of the ventricle through three pair of muscles, three muscles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">-36-</span>
on each side of the margin. <span class="smcap">Zaddach</span> De Apodis cancriformis anatome (pl. II fig.
XIV p. 68).</p>

<p>For the rest the marks of the attachment of the muscles are as a rule in the Crustacea,
at least those of the head, elevated small platforms, so in the Trilobites, of which I
have excellent specimens in a Bumastus and others. On the inside of the head of Limulus
they are faintly elevated patches. The small hollows on the inside of the hypostoma formed
by the macul&aelig; are indeed the sockets in which the soft parts of these more or less developed
hypostomic eyes were sheltered. But there is still a feature in the hypostoma of
Acidaspis which merits our attention and which perhaps may have a significance akin to
that of the macul&aelig;.</p>

<p>The hypostoma is square, with two short pointed wings, one on each side of the
slightly bent anterior margin and likewise two smaller ones at the corners of the posterior
margin. A groove follows on a short distance the lateral margins and the posterior
margin and disappears a little below the anterior one. In the same direction, distally,
though a little more inside and unconnected with them there are two small grooves, the
bottom of which consists of a shell substance of different colour and structure than the
other parts. Having been a little ground and seen in transmitted light it exhibits the
shape of a club and a homogenous yellow spot, tapering posteriorly and swelling out
distally (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I fig. 4</a>). It must be left an open question whether these macul&aelig; share in
the nature of visual organs as the quite different macul&aelig; of the other trilobites,
but it may be possible that it is so. It must, however, be remarked that there are
two types of hypostoma in the genus Acidaspis as shown by the illustrations of <span class="smcap">Barrande</span>.
One has the small grooves, possibly all sheltering the claviform macul&aelig;, disposed as in the
now described A. crenata. This group embraces five species of the Bohemian Silurian
formation. The other group of three species again has the hypostoma of the same quadratic
or rectangular shape, but the two short grooves, which may be expected to contain
the macul&aelig;, are placed midways between the anterior and the posterior margins,
nearly as the macul&aelig; bearing grooves of other trilobites. We have however not had
material for pursuing our researches in this genus, the other species of the Swedish Acidaspid&aelig;
being unknown as to their hypostoma.</p>

<p>It may here be added an observation concerning the ornamentation of the exterior
surface of the hypostoma of Ac. crenata. It is covered by a great number of diminutive
circular or oblong wartlets occupying the whole surface excepting the lower third of the
central field just above the posterior groove which is smooth. These wartlets seen through
transmitted light (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I fig. 5</a>) show in their interior something like a peculiar black spiculum
rising from a bifid rootlet and confined within the wartlet and not extruding from
it. In a longitudinal section (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I fig. 6</a>) the spicula perforate the wartlets reaching
through their whole length. As in Calymmene these interior pseudo-spicula are tubes,
filled with iron-pyrites. It is probable that these tubes were once bearing set&aelig; and quite
as in Apus formed a fur of bristles.</p>

<p>The structure of the cephalic eyes (<a href="#Plate_I">Pl. 1 f. 1-2</a>) is prismatic, but the separate
prisms are rather short and broad. Their lower or interior end is convex. The separating
lines between the single prisms are not always distinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">-37-</span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Agnostus</b> <span class="smcap">Dalm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_I">Pl. 1 fig. 7.</a></p>

<p>Agnostus glandiformis <span class="smcap">Ang.</span> Although there is not the slightest evidence of eyes
in this the largest of its genus, nor any free hypostoma hitherto has been found, we may
here give a little account of our researches into this species. The scantiness of material
forms a chief obstacle to our knowledge. Only three entire, rolled up specimens have
been found, and it is by sectioning and preparing such that any hope can be entertained
to gain reliable results.</p>

<p>A rolled up specimen from Andrarum Scania was sectioned lengthwise. The tail-piece
closed tight against the head-shield, so there had been little chance for foreign matter
to penetrate into the interior which, however, is filled. Close below the cephalic
shield there is a remarkable structure, mostly resembling an elongated intestine with swellings
joined by more narrow ducts and anteriorly the coherence is interrupted. As in
crustaceans and Arthropods in general the stomach and the intestine are situated on the
dorsal side of the body, there is nothing unlikely in assuming that this in reality may
be the remnants of the intestine. This may also be compared with the observation made
by <span class="smcap">Vollborth</span> in his memoir &raquo;Ueber die mit glatten Rumpfgliedern versehenen Trilobiten&raquo;,
1863, p. 46, tab. 1 fig. 12 where the heart-tube probably is delineated. <span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has
also given figures of what he considers as the intestine in Trinucleus.</p>

<p>Below this organ in Agnostus, there lies a section of a vaulted calcareous plate
with its convexity turned against the dorsal side of the head shield, that is to say quite
the reverse what might have been expected if it had been the hypostoma in its true
position. This may, however, not be any objection against considering it as a sectioned
hypostoma, loosened from its connection with the cephalic shield, disturbed in its original
position and turned round, when the shell became filled with mud. At the distal end
there is a much distinct duplicature.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus</b> <span class="smcap">Brongn.</span></p>

<p>The wellknown hypostoma of this genus has the same characteristic shape, though
more pronounced, as in Ptychopyge, with its posterior margin deeply indented, so as to
form two large, pointed lobes. There is properly only one median field, surrounded by
flat, lateral borders, continuing down into the posterior lobes, from which it is separated
through a shallow groove. The macula are situated in this groove, on each side of the
inferior border of the central field. They are more or less prominent, but whatever their
form may be, their surface is always entirely smooth, lying well circumscribed amidst
the surrounding terrace lines.</p>

<p>The following list enumerates all the species in this genus, of which previous authors
have delineated the tubercles, though they in the descriptions only in very few instances
have mentioned their presence.</p>

detail.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I figs. 8-17.</a></p>

<p>In the numerous specimens of which we have examined the hypostoma, there are
always small, nearly circular macul&aelig; which by their lighter colour are marked out from
the surrounding smooth space of the inferior sinus of the lateral grooves where they are
situated. They do not rise at all above the surrounding surface from which they are
separated only by a fine, scarcely perceptible line. On the interior surface of the hypostoma
they are better seen, and the enclosing line is deeper and more distinct. Their
surface is there quite as smooth and even as on the exterior side of the hypostoma.
They do not consequently in the least manner resemble muscular impressions as observable
on the inside of the glabella of other trilobites. These are on the contrary elevated above
the surface and finely striated in various ways.</p>

<p>The peculiar nature of these macula is revealed through the various sections we
have made. In <a href="#Plate_I">pl. I fig. 15</a> a vertical section across the entire hypostoma is represented.
The sectioned, dark macul&aelig; (a) lie on both sides of the faintly curved central
field, in the sinus of the lateral grooves, and the strongly developed terrace lines continue
sidewards just a little on the interior side, where the duplicature turns round. As seen
in a magnified vertical section (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 16</a>) the macul&aelig; consist of horizontal, whitish, straight
lines, probably lines of successive growth, and these are crossed rectangularly by more
irregular whitish lines separated from each other through dark spaces. The whole thus
gains the aspect of a dark surface cancellated by white lines. This reticulated or spongious
macula is enclosed as to its superior as well as to its inferior part in the compact and
homogenous test of the hypostoma and occluded from the influence of the light. Its
value as a visual organ consequently is insignificant. In a horizontal section (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 17</a>)
the structure is still more bewildering. There the whole macula is a confused, spongious
white mass with dark spaces between the white meshes, and only at one side, the left one,
some obscure indications as of polygones are visible. It would indeed have been impossible
to interprete what this means, had not the study of the cephalic eye given a clue thereof.</p>

<p>The eye of this species is covered with a delicate perfectly smooth and glossy integument
(<a href="#Plate_I">f. 12</a>) which is reposing immediately on the prismatic lenses of the cornea.
In a few instances, depending on the colour or the state of preservation of that integument
the lenses are indistinctly translucent. Owing to their state of preservation
their aspect is greatly variable. They are in many instances, as seen in fig. 9, six-sided
or some rhombic, foursided or even quadratic (<a href="#Plate_I">f. 8, 10</a>). They are all of
the same length, 0,2 mm. along the surface proper of the eye, but are lengthened to
0,3 mm. towards the border of the eyes, <a href="#Plate_I">f. 12</a>, which will be described further on;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span>
they are of equal breadth, amounting to 0,066 mm. Their inferior ends are slightly convex
or nearly plane when well preserved, else, when as often is the case, disintegrated as
to be scooped out and vaulted. Their interior structure, as revealed by sections, shows
a cylindrical core, <a href="#Plate_I">f. 8-10</a>, composed of concentric strata. This cylinder fills nearly the
whole interior space of the prisms, there being, however, in many instances a compact
dark mass between the cylinder and the walls of the prisms. There are also sections in
which the prisms are filled with a uniformly black mass without any concentric structure.
In longitudinal sections the outlines of the individual prisms are not clearly discernible
(<a href="#Plate_I">f. 11</a>). There are longitudinal, white lines of varying thickness with lateral irregular
offshoots, which may join with those from opposite walls, and give the interior a sort of
spongious or cancellate appearance.</p>

<p>Towards both sides of the ocular surface, towards the superior and inferior side, a
change sets in as to the shape of the lenses, as best seen in horizontal sections (<a href="#Plate_I">figs. 8, 10</a>)
they are lengthened and become more and more indistinct, and at last in the upper and
lower marginal zones pass over into a reticulate, spongious mass, which seen in a longitudinal
section presents almost the same aspect as in the regular prismatic surface of the
eye. <a href="#Plate_I">Fig. 11 <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#Plate_I"><i>a</i></a> being the visual field. It is, however, more densely reticulate,
but a prismatic arrangement is quite as much evident as in the ocular surface proper. In
the rule the passage from the prismatic surface to the reticulate is gradual, the prisms
becoming by and by irregular in their outline and diminishing in size (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 12, <i>a</i></a> the eye
proper, <a href="#Plate_I"><i>b</i></a> the border zone), but there are also instances where the distinction between
these two fields is sharp and without any gradual transition. In the inferior reticulate
zone there are generally some oblongue, funnelshaped pits. I am uncertain whether they
are to be regarded as regular parts of the eye structure or rather as burrows of some
parasite. They do not continue deep down.</p>

<p>If we now compare the reticulate zone of the eye with the macul&aelig; of the hypostoma,
for instance the vertical section <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 16</a> with <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 11 <i>b</i></a>, we find the most complete
identity in structure. In the same manner the horizontal section of the border zone of
the eye, <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 8 <i>a</i></a>, <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 10 <i>b</i></a>, and of the macula, <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 17</a> are similar. The same chaotic,
spongious mass in both, with some tendency to form prisms more evident in the longitudinal
sections, where the same reticulate structure with predominant white, longitudinal
streaks is so palpable. That there is a complete identity in structure between the two,
the macula of the hypostoma and the border zones of the eye, is as evident as anything
can be, but as to the functional identity or what this function may have been it is difficult
to decide anything with certainty, at least it seems to me that the capacity of vision
must in both have been far more restricted than in the eye proper. They rather give
the impression as of rudimentary visual organs.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus raniceps</b> <span class="smcap">Dalm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I f. 23-26.</a></p>

<p>The macul&aelig; of the hypostoma are placed obliquely in the saline manner as in the
preceding species. They are more prominent and the oblong macula, with the longest diameter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span>
of 1,2 mm. is on the top of a little mound and surrounded by a fine, elevated
marginal line (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 23</a>). Its somewhat convex surface is entirely smooth and if sectioned
horizontally exhibits the same sort of spongy texture as A. expansus (<a href="#Plate_I">pl. I f. 24</a>). In a
vertical section (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 25</a>) the macula does not occupy so large a space as in As. expansus,
but rather lies as a lenticular disk in the hypostomic test closer to the superior
surface than the inferior. With sufficiently high power the same sort of pillars, divided
by horizontal strata is seen. Upon the whole the vertical section is not so clearly
developed. The reticulate zone of the eye is more definitely separated front the prismatic
zone than in A. expansus. There can be no doubt that there is a correspondence in this
species between the structure of the macula! and the spongious zone of the eyes.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus cornigerus</b> <span class="smcap">Schloth.</span> (A. Kowalewskyi <span class="smcap">Lawrow</span>).</p>

<p>Of this strange species with its enormous eyestalks, more than 2 centimeters in
length I have through the kindness of Akademiker <span class="smcap">Friedr. Schmidt</span> in St. Petersburg
had occasion to study some specimens.</p>

<p>The rather large macul&aelig;, obovate-circular, are like those of several other Esthonian
species oriented inwards and upwards instead of inwards and downwards as in the Swedish
species described. As the specimens have suffered through corrosion of the surface there
are only faint traces of a marginal line. Their microscopic structure is badly preserved,
and they look pale and transparent with only few indications of the spongious texture.
The lenses of the cephalic eye are nearly square prisms sometimes with a slight approach
to hexaedral pillars. There is no clear transition into a spongious or reticulate border
zone. But this may depend upon the bad preservation.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus fallax</b> <span class="smcap">Dalm.</span>?</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I fig. 18-22.</a></p>

<p>It is very difficult to distinguish this species or rather variety from A. expansus,
but if we have found genuine specimens, there are some points in the shape of eyes and
macul&aelig; which make it different. The hypostoma (<a href="#Plate_I">f. 21</a>) is rather more broad and the
duplicature is large with an upturned margin. The little macula is placed on the top of
a smooth rounded elevation and enclosed by an elevated rim.</p>

<p>The cephalic eves are rather short, regular hexaedral prisms (<a href="#Plate_I">f. 18-20</a>) and as
shown in <a href="#Plate_I">fig. 18</a> change into irregular squares near the border of the eve.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus</b> sp.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_I">Pl. I fig. 27-30.</a></p>

<p>from the islet of Sand&ouml;, north of Gotland. Although we cannot give any account of its
hypostoma, not having had sufficient material, the structure of the eyes is so peculiar
that it seems worthy of being recorded. The integument is extremely thin and transparent
and the subjacent lenses are clearly seen, and through their impact on the thin
integument they make this to stand out in a very low relief above them (<a href="#Plate_I">fig. 27</a>). These
lenses are uncommonly short, forming at the surface rather oblong, slightly hexaedral
prisms with a narrow interspace between them. In a section lower down they have the
shape of hollow, white rings filled with black mud and in a longitudinal section the white
walls of the lenses look like short pointed spikes and interiorly they are completely empty.
We here find also the same gradual change from regular cones to the spongious border
zone as in the above mentioned species <a href="#Plate_I">f. 29</a>. The border zone is finely reticulated.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Asaphus (Isotelus) gigas</b> <span class="smcap">J. Hall.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 1-3.</a></p>

<p>The enormous hypostoma of this giant resembles in a high degree that of the Asaphi,
but is at the same time the most evident verification of the experience that the
hypostoma <i>per se</i> cannot be regarded as the sole criterion for determinating the generic
affinities of different species. The whole structure of this trilobite in other respects gives
it a quite independent position, distinct, from Asaphus.</p>

<p>We have had at our disposal several specimens of the large hypostoma, the dimensions
of the largest, fragmentary in its anterior margin, being as follows: breadth 48 mm.
length 41 mm., probably 47 mm. when entire, breadth of each of the posterior lobes at
their bases 19 mm., length of the same 23 mm. The macul&aelig; which are placed on the
flat surface of the hypostoma without being at all elevated, are prominent through their
great size and their pale, whitish colour. They are somewhat oblongue having their
longest axis directed inwards and downwards. They attain a diameter of four millimeters.
Horizontally sectioned, <a href="#Plate_II">f. 2</a>, they show the spongious texture and vertically the quasi prismatic
reticulate structure richly developed, <a href="#Plate_II">f. 3</a>. The pillars are very distinct and continue
without interruption all through the macula and in the interstices there are traverses
joining between two pillars or partially filling the darkish interspaces, thus giving the
whole the aspect of some &raquo;tabulate&raquo; coral sectioned. By the inspection of the horizontal
section alone, presenting the irregular spongy texture it would have been impossible to
imagine the ordinated arrangement which the vertical section reveals to us. The eyes
consist of regular hexaedral prisms, and there is a very sharp boundary line between
them and the spongious zone, which is very narrow and without distinct separating lines
joins with the cephalic test. For the rest there are in all probability at least two different
species sent from America under the name of Isotelus gigas, of which only the largest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">-43-</span>
almost like a Homalonotus, and the hypostoma of which has been partly delineated in
this memoir, seems to be the real one. They differ both in the shape of the hypostoma
as well as in other respects.</p>

where several hypostomas belonging to species of this genus are delineated, not a single
one shows these tubercles. We shall now continue the descriptions of the Swedish Brontei,
already begun with Br. polyactin in the introductory part of this memoir.</p>

<p>has a hypostoma that much resembles that of Br. polyactin. In its general shape it is
similar and the two concentric grooves with the two macul&aelig; placed in the same way,
just below the superior groove. These macul&aelig; are much larger than in Br. polyactin,
nearly thrice their size. They are also more ovate or rather like a bean, the smooth
surface is larger and the granulated spot restricted to a more narrow space forming an
oblique patch. The granules or lenses are also individually larger than in the allied
species, double their size or 0,06 millimeters. We have not succeeded in making sections
of the cephalic eye nor of the macul&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Br. platyactin</b> <span class="smcap">Angelin</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II f. 14-19.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma has a transversally triangular form, and is divided only in two
fields through a shallow semicircular groove near the posterior margin. The two macul&aelig;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">-44-</span>
are situated above the groove near its superior sinuses. They are elongated, <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 17</a>,
elliptic with the narrow pointed end directed outwards and the broad rounded end
inwards. The chief surface is scooped out as a shallow depression. The granulated spot
is situated on the broader end and covering it completely. The relatively large lenses
are arranged in five regular rows, the uppermost one being the longest. On the interior
surface of the hypostoma there are the corresponding sockets of both macul&aelig; with
smooth surface. The horizontal sections of the granules <a href="#Plate_II">figs. 18, 19</a> present the image
of white rings in close contact, without, however, to occasion a prismatic structure, a
dark interspace lying between each ring. These lenses are filled with a dark mass, and
in some the same sort of radiated structure is perceptible as in the lenses of the cephalic
eye. In horizontal sections of the cephalic eye the lenses approach the polyedral
shape. In another section near to the surface of another specimen the lenses are decidedly
hexaedral. The vertical sections, <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 14</a>, reveal their real nature as lenses where
they lie as a string of beads with a dark nucleus enclosed within a thin whitish shell.
They are covered by a thin membranous lining. When seen in transmitted light the
lenses proper are dark, and the shell white and in reflected light the lenses are lighter
than the rest.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Br. laticauda</b> <span class="smcap">Angel.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 6-13.</a></p>

<p>Lower Silurian from Dalecarlia. The hypostoma, <a href="#Plate_II">f. 10</a>, is of a broad clypeate shape,
the anterior margin rounded without any large projecting wings. On the exterior surface
there are two grooves parallel with the rounded inferior margin. As in Br. polyactin the
two elliptic tubercles are situated on the inferior edge or slope of the upper groove and
they are deepened by a shallow depression as in Br. platyactin. The granulated spot
situated along the posterior margin of the macula deviates much in shape from that
of the other species. It consists of a long and narrow stripe ending in a fine point outwards
and widening inwards, where it is rounded, forming thus a claviform, curved elevation.
Around the granulated area the macul&aelig; are quite smooth, and show in a horizontal
section an irregular structure of tiny black dots nearly resembling the structure
of the hypostomic shell. We have not been able to obtain any good vertical section, but
by casts of the interior side of the tubercles it is found that the granules form polyedric
facets like those of the eyes though perhaps not so regular. There is a specimen with
the granules intact, and the polyedric shape is then not so distinct.</p>

<p>Sections of the eyes elucidate the structure, which partially is obscure in other species
of Bronteus. There is a thin membranous coating covering the subjacent well formed
lenses (<a href="#Plate_II">fig. 8</a>). When this membrane in some instances has been peeled off the lenses lie
bare (<a href="#Plate_II">fig. 9</a>). These have a dark nucleus and in some instances it seems as if there were
two. In a vertical section they look spheroidal, in a horizontal section again they are
polyedric, especially when taken somewhat below the surface or near the middle line
(<a href="#Plate_II">fig. 6</a>). In <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 7</a>, some lenses are delineated in a horizontal section, highly magnified
and the corallian appearance is evident. The lenses are well separated by distinct lines,
and from their inner tubes whitish reticulations radiate towards the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">-45-</span></p>

<p>If we now compare these sections, where the lenses are so distinctly seen, with
the more obscure sections of other Brontei, it is evident that the dark points in them
are nothing but transformed and deteriorated centres of the lenses. In Br. platyactin
they are a little more distinct than in the other species. And it is with these that the
granulated spots on the macul&aelig; of the hypostoma are most concordant.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Bronteus</b> sp. indet.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 28-30.</a></p>

<p>This species, of which only the hypostoma is known, found at Lansa, Gotland, is
likely, to judge by that, to be nearly related to Br. polyactin. The shape of this hypostoma
is exactly the same and the macul&aelig; are placed in the same position, but they are
larger, a little sunk on the blind surface and the group of the lenses is different. Its
superior margin forms an ingoing arch and the lenses themselves are not convex, but
rounded or slightly polyedric, and separated through thick interspaces.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Bumastus</b> <span class="smcap">Murchison</span>.</p>

<p>The only recorded hypostoma with macul&aelig; belongs to B. insignis <span class="smcap">Hall</span> as described
by <span class="smcap">Salter</span> Monogr. p. 208 pl. 27 fig. 7. He says: &raquo;A pair of compressed tubercles
occurs at the lower third: they are transverse-ovate, and more than their own diameter
apart.&raquo; This is nearly in concordance with what is seen on the species to be described
below.</p>

<p>Although it can in reality be said that the species of Bumastus are the most common
of all trilobites in the Silurium of Gotland, in so far that their head pieces and pygidia
are met with everywhere in the limestone rocks of the island, the find of entire
specimens or of detached hypostomas is amongst the rarest events when collecting there
and amongst thousands of fragments, in several places entirely filling large portions of
the limestone rock, there have in the Swedish State museum been acquired only three or
four hypostomas, which we are now going to describe.</p>

<p>At first we must point out a certain resemblance which prevails between the hypostomas
and macul&aelig; in Bumastus and Bronteus. Compare for instance Bum. sulcatus with
Br. platyactin and Br. laticauda. The general form is nearly the same in both and the
shape of the macul&aelig; almost identical but for the complete want of granulations on those
of Bumastus. To this resemblance must be added that there are, as known, forms of
trilobites which by some authors have been regarded as Brontei and by others, again,
ranked amongst the Ill&aelig;nid&aelig;.</p>

<p>Three species of Bumastus have been recorded as found in the Gotland strata, but
of one of these no hypostoma is known. Besides, to judge by the head shields and hypostoma,
there are a few new species. To begin with the most common</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>B. sulcatus</b> <span class="smcap">Ldm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 33-40.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma is broadly shield-formed and the anterior margin is most characteristic
being in its central part elongated in a short evenly rounded projection. The side wings
are triangular acuminate, bent a little backwards and towards the interior surface. There
is only a single rounded field passing into an evenly bent border, in front of which the
projecting, elliptic macul&aelig; lie. A second pair of wings stretches backwards near the
posterior margin. We have not obtained any sections of the macul&aelig;.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes <a href="#Plate_II">figs. 36-38</a> are covered with an uncommonly thick stratum of
homogenous shell, one and a half times as thick as the subjacent lenses. These are comparatively
broad, above passing indistinctly in the covering stratum, below, at their basis,
convex. In a horizontal section <a href="#Plate_II">figs. 33, 34</a> they exhibit the common hexaedral or pentaedric
aspect, their exterior sides being white and confluent without any separating lines.
Their interior is dark and from the polygonal sides white lines go in giving the whole
the appearance as of a starry, composite coral with its septa. The correspondence in
structure with Bronteus laticauda <a href="#Plate_II">pl. II fig. 7</a> is striking. A narrow space separates the
surface of the eye from a nearly similar patch below the eve on the cheek <a href="#Plate_II">35 <i>b</i>, 38 <i>b</i></a>.
But there the position of the composing strata is singularly reversed and the spongious
or pseudo-prismatic stratum lies close to the outside and the homogenous stratum on the
inside. The white longitudinal lines are well marked out and regular in the vertical
section, <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 38 <i>b</i></a>, indicating the prismatic structure most clearly.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>B. barriensis</b> <span class="smcap">Murch.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 31, 32.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 31</a> is of so transverse a shape that the breadth much surpasses
the height, the former being 6 millim., while the latter attains only 3,5 millim.
The anterior margin is so much arcuated and sloping backwards that it forms an obtuse
angle. The side wings are triangular and acuminated and from them a thick pad runs
backwards and forms the posterior margin. Below the largest field of the exterior surface
the macul&aelig; rest on a ridge having a much elongated, vermiform shape and sunk in
the surface (<a href="#Plate_II">fig. 32</a>) a little more than three times longer than broad. In its shape it approaches
much to the hypostoma of Bum. insignis <span class="smcap">Hall</span> as delineated by <span class="smcap">Salter</span> pl. 27 fig. 7.</p>

<p>In another, undetermined Bumastus (<a href="#Plate_II">pl. II figs. 47, 48</a>)<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the hypostoma (from
Klints, Othem, isle of Gotland) is of a more elongate obovate form, the anterior margin
elevated, rounded, the terrace lines faint, the tubercles are larger than in the former
Bumasti, oblong, curved, beanshaped, evenly rounded and smooth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> Probably the same as Bum. sulcatus pl. XII fig. 12 in my paper on the Trilobites of Gotland 1885.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">-47-</span></p>

<p>Another of the new species is one that <span class="smcap">Liljevall</span> has found at Korpklint near
Wisby (<a href="#Plate_II">Pl. II figs. 41-46</a>). The hypostoma is more elongate than transverse with the
anterior margin regularly arcuated, by far not so prominent as in B. sulcatus and the
former. By a shallow groove the exterior surface is divided in two fields, the anterior
one the largest and covered with a few, distantiated, concentric terrace lines. The posterior
field is smooth, nearly even and the macul&aelig; lie just in the groove, with their axis
oblique to the longitudinal axis of the hypostoma, beanshaped and smooth. The cephalic
eyes show in a horizontal section hexaedral white walls enclosing a dark space in which
some indistinct radii emanate, <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 41 <i>a</i></a>. In the vertical sections the prisms are narrow
and elongate and the integument by far not so thick as in Bumastus sulcatus, <a href="#Plate_II">fig. 42, 43</a>.
The border zone of the eye in this (<a href="#Plate_II">fig. 41</a>) as well as in B. sulcatus, as seen in horizontal
sections, agrees with that of the Asaphid&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Bumastus</b> sp. inlet.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III fig. 1, 2.</a></p>

<p>In a detached piece of limestone, found in Gotland, at Norderstrand, near Wisby,
two hypostomas and a free cheek lay embedded along with a coral of the genus Acantholithus
and a Bronteus probably belonging to a new species. As the coral has not been
found above the uppermost beds of the Lower Silurian it is probable that the trilobites
also are derived from the same horizon.</p>

<p>The hypostoma, figured <a href="#Plate_III">pl. III fig. 1</a>, is broadly tongueshaped, with a short, blunt,
triangular wing on each side of the anterior margin. The exterior side is nearly
completely occupied by a single large field, which is convex and decorated by sparse
terrace lines. Below this a smooth, nearly even plane, reaching to the inferior, elevated
border of the hypostoma. The two tubercular macula' are situated exactly on the boundary
line between the convex and the plane field. They are elongately ovate, pointed
outwards, rounded inwards, with smooth and glossy surface. That portion, on which in
the species of Bronteus the granular spot rests, is transversally wrinkled by some faintly
elevated, sigmoid lines (<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 2</a>). It would have been of great interest to investigate the
interior structure of these curious macul&aelig;, but the scarcity of the material has prevented
our doing so.</p>

<p>The other hypostoma, <a href="#Plate_III">pl. III fig. 3-5</a>, is larger and has the terrace lines more
distantiated and forming more open curves, but for the rest it is of the same shape as
the smaller, so that we may not ascribe these small deviations to a specific difference.
The macul&aelig; are more elongated, narrow, curved tubercles, thus differing from the next
preceding. A section running through its left tubercle does not show any structure, but
the shell of the macul&aelig; is extremely thin, thus contrasting strongly with the surrounding
thicker shell, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 4 <i>a</i></a>. The cephalic eye, again, remaining on the free cheek found in
the same piece of limestone and probably belonging to the same specimen, has its surface
well preserved and exhibits semiglobular lenses in low relief, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>The clypeiform hypostoma is divided in two fields, one anterior larger, in the
centre elevated in a short, blunt knob, and a posterior, bearing the two elevated rounded
macul&aelig;, just below the semicircular groove which separates it from the anterior field.
These fields are surrounded by a large border which is posteriorly emarginated through
a short rounded sinus. The surface is entirely covered by small semiglobular wartlets
perforated by a straight pore or duct, which being filled with a black mineral, probably
iron pyrites, gives a peculiar and characteristic aspect to the sections. In the same manner
the whole mass of the hypostoma is pierced by straight, black lines, also filled up
pores, starting from the outside and ending before attaining the inner surface.</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; are prominent, separated from the hypostoma through narrow, distinct
grooves, ovate, with the pointed end directed obliquely outwards, against the margins of
the hypostoma. They are covered with wartlets and leaving only a little oblong spot
free, quite smooth, this being consequently the macula proper. But in a longitudinal
section there is not the least distinction between this macula and the other hypostoma,
only, that it is free of pores.</p>

<p>We have succeeded to prepare a horizontal section of the macula. This is oval,

But as there is no mention of them, and as they are quite unlike the macula? which are
described here, I am in doubt of their real nature. We have figured a macula from the
hypostoma of a Chasmops, probably Ch. macroura, from a drift block near Rostock. It
is elongate and narrow, more than four times longer than broad. Its smooth surface is
a little scooped out and no structure is observable.</p>

<p>The exterior surface of the hypostoma is entirely covered with small wartlets,
closely set, of different size in the various species, and spread between them lie a great
number of elongate smooth spots dispersed, on the interior side of the hypostoma showing
an excavated surface (<a href="#Plate_III">pl. III fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 17-21.</a></p>

<p>The shape of the hypostoma is shown in <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 21 pl. III</a>. It is regularly shield-formed
with posterior margin rounded. A shallow groove running parallel with the
margins forms a large, faintly elevated border. The anterior margin projects on both
sides in a short, backwards directed, broad and fiat wing, hollowed out with a pit on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span>
front side, and there is a posterior lateral wing, midways between the anterior and posterior
margin short, blunt, directed obliquely backwards. The whole exterior surface is
covered with diminutive tubercles, the above mentioned smooth spots interspersed on the
central disk. A little below the middle there are two lengthened pits, so shallow that
they often are not discernible. In a specimen of Chirurus spinulosus <span class="smcap">Nieczkowski</span> from
Estland there are two, almost 3 mm. long dots, one on each side above the macul&aelig; as
the <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 21</a> shows and in several others of this generic group there are also indications
of similar. I cannot compare these dots with anything more than the lengthened spots
visible in Acidaspis crenata.</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; are wanting in this species, but the cephalic eyes are well developed.
A section of them <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 19</a> shows the enormous difference of the shell in the eye and
the surroundings where the shell surpasses it many times in thickness. The eye consists
in fact only of the ovate, beadlike lenses of which a string is seen sectioned in the figure
mentioned. More enlarged (<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 20</a>) a nucleus is visible in each lens, and in a horizontal
section (<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 18</a>) a little below the surface, where they are more pressed against
themselves, they have a polygonal shape. The <a href="#Plate_III">figure 17</a> seems to represent lenses that
have been much changed interiorly, having only a narrow zone left of the primary structure.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 12-14.</a></p>

<p>The cephalic eyes have globular lenses, of more than double the size of those in
Chir. clavifrons. The difference between the lenses and the surrounding shell amounts
at the highest to thrice the former, while in Ch. clavifrons it is at least seven times as
much. In a horizontal section the lenses have a little, darkish irregular nucleus surrounded
by a radiated structure (<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; (<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 14</a>) are slightly concave, oblong, smooth, surrounded by comparatively

<p>The exterior surface of the hypostoma is sparingly covered by granules of larger
size than in other Chiruri. The macul&aelig; as seen in a cast are prominent near the posterior
border, sunk in their centre and surrounded by a narrow distinct border line. In
a horizontal section it as not been possible to detect any peculiar structure, only a dark

preserved, standing out black on the white surface, oblong, 1,5 millim. in greatest length
(<a href="#Plate_III">fig. 15</a>). There are indications as of a great number of small lenses on these macul&aelig;.
Remarkable are the two elongated spots, almost 3 mm. in length, above these macul&aelig;,
of which already mention has been made under Ch. clavifrons.</p>

<p>The hypostoma of an undescribed species from &Ouml;land. The macul&aelig; are lengthened,
ellipsoid and smooth tubercles lying in a groove. The finely granulated surface of the
hypostoma shows rare smooth spots interspersed, being on the inside smooth pits, from
which again in casts of the hypostoma larger tubercles are moulded. Of the same
nature are those that are visible on the nucleus of Chir. speciosus and others. There
are still some undescribed Lower Silurian species, for instance one nearly related to Ch.

Dalecarlia, 33 millim. in length, has a longitudinal macula, 2 millim. in length, as seen
on the inside of the fragment.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI fig. 10</a> a little hypostoma is delineated that shows some resemblance
with that of the Chirurus, but probably belongs to some other, unknown genus. It is
Upper Silurian, found at Mulde in Fr&ouml;jel, Gotland. It is of an elongated ovate shape,
with the anterior border faintly arched, the anterior wings broad, truncate. A narrow
elevated border surrounds the lateral and posterior margins. The somewhat vaulted surface
is covered by fine granulations, and the macula, situated on equal distance from the
anterior and posterior margins are ovate, smooth and directed obliquely inwards. There
are two minute pointed processes on each side of the lateral borders and one on each
side of the pointed posterior margin.</p>

fig. 9. The anterior wings are larger and obtuse, excavated below and the border rim is
not so distinct all round as he has figured. There are two pair of oblique, lengthened
grooves above each other. The opposite do not, however, join to form a coherent groove
across the median field of the hypostoma, which is level between them. No macul&aelig;.
Nearer the anterior border close below the wings, there is a small roundish, dark spot.

<p>The hypostoma is elongated, anterior margin evenly arched, anterior wings triangular,
lateral margins faintly curved as well as the posterior margin, at both sides of
which there is one diminutive spine. The posterior wings are short forming a spiny
process from the lateral margin. The surface of the hypostoma is smooth with a shallow
transverse groove on the inferior moiety and two corresponding lateral impressions below
it, one on each side. The elevated lateral borders are longitudinally striated by a few
terrace lines. There are no macul&aelig; visible. The eves consist f short hexagonal prisms
(<a href="#Plate_III">figs. 22, 23</a>) nearly resembling those of Proetus.</p>

<p><i>D. Mac Coyi</i> <span class="smcap">Barr.</span> Supl., pl. 13 f. 32. This magnificent hypostoma belongs to
the same group as D. micrurus <span class="smcap">Hall</span> as to which we may hesitate whether there not be
a double pair of macul&aelig; above each other near the posterior border. In this species,
however, there is the transverse lower groove and above probably the two macul&aelig; united
by a groove so closely as to resemble the lower groove.</p>

what I think we positively must interpret as a double pair of macul&aelig; close above each
other. As stated above there is reason to believe that in other species of Dalmanites
there also are indications of four macul&aelig;, though not so evident as in this species.
<span class="smcap">Barrande</span> says nothing about this remarkable feature.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 43, 44.</a></p>

<p>The interesting image, as given by the agglomerated eyes, is represented in the
magnified <a href="#Plate_III">figure 43 Plate III</a>. The lenses lie there separated from each other at much
varying distance, some in close contact. The presence of the delicate covering membrane
is clearly seen, being of white colour contrasting with the black, glossy lens. It is much
lacerated and only preserved around the periphery. The size of the ocelli is on an
average 0,5 mm., a little one has 0,3 mm. The surface between the ocelli is most finely
granulated. The granules scarcely attaining the fourth of the granules in Dalm. vulgaris.</p>

<p>In a vertical section the regular biconvex lenses are seen to be covered with the
extremely thin integument, which is a direct continuation from the test. The test between
the lenses is perforated by some longitudinal tubes, as usual in the skeleton of
the trilobites. We have not found any hypostoma with the macul&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Dalmanites obtusus</b> <span class="smcap">Ldm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 45, 46.</a></p>

<p>We have not succeeded in finding any hypostoma, but as the structure of the
cephalic eyes is sufficiently well preserved, we here describe it. The lenses seen from
the surface look globular, and in a vertical section they are ovate and in a horizontal
circular. They are covered by a very thin and delicate membrane, that envelops their
superior moiety completely and between the eyes it is enclosed by the surrounding test
and growing out from it. In the horizontal section, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 45</a>, it looks as a circular frame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">-54-</span>
around the lenses and the membranes of two contiguous lenses sometimes lie so close,
that they entirely fill up the interspace between the lenses, leaving only a narrow slit
between them marking their boundaries. The space between the lenses, fig. 46, is porous,
being perforated by tubes, which continue vertically down through the shell of the cheek.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Dalm. sclerops</i> <span class="smcap">Dalman</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV fig. 3.</a></p>

<p>Commonly this species has been ranged with Phacops, but it is evident that it as
to the conformation of its glabella and the head in general is highly discrepant, and in
these respects is more concordant with Dalmanites, though still deviating as for instance
in the pygidium and some details of the head. Therefore it may be justified with <span class="smcap">Friedr.
Schmidt</span><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to consider it as a generic division, though not, as he has it, as an independent
genus, but as a subgenus of Dalmanites.</p>

<p>The granulated hypostoma differs from that of Dalmanites proper in having the anterior
margin strongly arched, the pointed wings almost on the median line of the hypostoma.
There is one groove near the posterior border and the macul&aelig; lie as two, narrow
long, crescentic grooves close below the wings. The few sections give no clear idea of
any structure.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes are constructed on the same plan as in the previous species, the
lenses being surrounded by a frame.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Dalm. vulgaris</i> <span class="smcap">Salter</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 47-52.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma has the common shield-like shape, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 51</a>, anteriorly slightly arcuated,
the short obtuse wings curvated towards the interior surface. It is finely granulated.
The groove does not go so near the cuspidate posterior margin as in other species. The
two macul&aelig;, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 52</a>, are narrow and elliptic, somewhat convex and lie in a little concavity,
a narrow smooth space around is devoid of the granules, which cover the surface
of the rest. They show absolutely no structure, excepting a few indistinct blackish spots.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes have been often described and delineated. Most detailed are the
descriptions and figures given by <span class="smcap">Salter</span> in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey Dec. II.
pl. 1. In the figure 4 a part of the surface is shown in well preserved state. He says
that &raquo;the cornea is ... present and distinctly convex over each lens, the intermediate
portions being ornamented with tubercles and granules&raquo;. He thinks also that there are
undeveloped or small lenses between the larger. His fig. 5 represents the frames around
the lenses, these being probably lost. His explanation of fig. 6 I cannot understand.
There are weathered or spoilt lenses figured.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the granulated surface of the head continues between the
more or less free lying lenses as shown here in a new figure taken from a specimen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">-55-</span>
from Dudley, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 47</a>. The granules of the surface are larger and more rare between
the ocelli than for instance in Dalm. imbricatulus. Small lenses, undeveloped as <span class="smcap">Salter</span>
calls them, may in fact only be such granules of somewhat larger size than usual. Lenses
having the appearance as in <span class="smcap">Salter's</span> fig. 6, as if a covering was partially destroyed and
the lens visible below it, I have also found in Swedish specimens, as represented in <a href="#Plate_III">fig.
47</a>. In a vertical section, <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 50</a>, a delicate covering integument is seen and the oval
lenses lie regularly with their frames around them quite as in Dalmanites obtusus and
in horizontal sections, <a href="#Plate_III">figs. 48, 49</a>, there are also the same sort of black, irregular dots,
being the sectioned tubes of the surface between the lenses. But in another feature there
is great interest. Beneath each lens there are fascicules of tiny rods, twice as long as
the lenses. They are represented in a vertical section in <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 50</a> and in a tangential section
in <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 49</a>.</p>

<p>As our imperfect knowledge of so delicate anatomical structures in fossil crustaceans
does not admit of secure comparisons with the visual organs of recent crustaceans, no
suggestion can be given to interpret their nature. Probably they have no connection
with the structure of the eyes and it is not even certain that they are of organic origin.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Dysplanus</b> <span class="smcap">Burm.</span></p>

<p>If there were no other characters to distinguish this genus from Ill&aelig;nus its strangely
deviating hypostoma must do it. We have examined two species and in both the hypostoma
is almost oval, evenly rounded both anteriorly and posteriorly. Near the anterior
border two narrow, long hornlike wings project. They are flattened, thin and lamellar
from the basis and end in a hollow, acuminated point.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>D. centrotus</b> <span class="smcap">Dalm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III figs. 53-56.</a></p>

<p>This species has the macul&aelig; placed near the posterior border, in a semilunar flat,
devoid of the terrace-lines. The macul&aelig; are elongated tubercles and do not show any
structure when sectioned. The cephalic eyes have a thin membrane covering the short
cupshaped lenses, which, closely packed, in the transverse section give the usual polygonal
mosaic of hexaeders. They have a radiate structure, when decayed.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>D. ladogensis</i> <span class="smcap">Holm</span>.</p>

<p>A specimen from &Ouml;land has the macul&aelig; lying in the large field of terrace lines
above the smooth zone at the posterior margin of the hypostoma. They are larger than
in the former species, pearshaped, smooth and no structure visible.</p>

<p>I cannot find any former figure indicating the macul&aelig; of the hypostoma in this

<p>As to the shape of the singularly formed hypostoma in the three Swedish species
Encr. punctatus, obtusus and l&aelig;vis we have found the anterior border so characteristic
in them that it is sufficient to distinguish them from each other and to annul the doubts
concerning the distinction of Encr. l&aelig;vis from Encr. punctatus. We therefore in <a href="#Plate_IV">pl. IV
figs. 12-17</a> give the anterior margins of these three species, along with the profiles.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Encrin. punctatus</i> <span class="smcap">Wahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 5-9, 12, 13.</a></p>

<p>The surface of the hypostoma is so finely and obscurely granulated that it seems
to be almost smooth. It is in the shallow groove above the lamellar tongueshaped posterior
border that the elongated tubercular macula are situated. They are prominent
and in horizontal sections they have a surface mottled by irregular black and white specks,
the whole surrounded by a white border, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 6</a>. This border and the other surface is
pierced by series of parallel slitlike pores, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 7</a>, a feature peculiar to this genus. The
vertical sections indicate a chain of indistinct prisms with a black, rounded central
hollow between thick strata of clear whitish shell substance, <a href="#Plate_IV">figs. 8, 9</a>. The shell substance

<p>The macul&aelig; lie as oblong, smooth tubercles surrounded by the irregularly grown

from the interior surface of the macula, as seen in transmitted light, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 21</a>, this is
white with only a few grey spots and on the superior border black streaks, lying obliquely.
The substance of the shell around the macula is perforated by the minutest
pores amongst which a few larger are intermingled. The granules are also perforated
as those in Calymmene and the tubes continue through the shell, visible by their black
colour.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus</b> <span class="smcap">Dalman</span>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, considering the great number of species in this almost exclusively
Lower Silurian species, that there is none but a single species in which the macul&aelig;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">-58-</span>
hitherto have been delineated. This is Ill&aelig;nus angustifrons var. depresses <span class="smcap">Holm</span> I, pl. VIII
fig. 18. A little, fragmentary hypostoma with globular macul&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus Chiron</b> <span class="smcap">Holm</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 22-25.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma has the shape characteristic of all true Ill&aelig;ni, viz. a straight anterior
margin with two large flat rectangular or nearly quadratic wings, a globular or spherical
median field, forming the chief portion of the exterior surface, which is covered by some
rare, fine, terrace lines. In some other Ill&aelig;ni the surface is smooth. At the posterior
base of the median field the two macul&aelig; are placed, tiny, oblong, but lying on the same
level, at right angles to the median longitudinal axis of the hypostoma. They are covered
with lenses of irregular and indistinct shape <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 25</a>. I do not think that they in this
and the other species of Tiberius are lenses of the same conformation as in Bronteus,
they are rather the tops of the subjacent lenses which are of the prismatic form. The
cephalic eyes do not show any lenses on the outside. They have a narrow, opaque exterior
integument, hiding hexaedral, thickly packed, straight prisms, forming a stratum
in thickness of 0,2 millim.</p>

<p>The hypostoma consists of several thin layers of superposed calcite, which easily
peal off, so that it is seldom that the true exterior sculptured surface remains.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus Esmarki</b> <span class="smcap">Schloth</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 26-33.</a></p>

<p>This the most common of all the Ill&aelig;ni has in several specimens shown the hypostoma
with the macul&aelig; in situ. The hypostoma is smooth excepting on the marginal
ridges where there are some terrace lines. On the median axis of the central gibbosity
(<a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 30</a>) five faintly visible transverse folds are situated, a curious feature which we have
not observed in any other trilobite. The macul&aelig; are exceedingly small, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 31</a>, elongate,
spindleshaped and acuminated in both ends. On their surface there are accumulated
several lenslike globules. As the horizontal sections show there are, however, no regular
lenses, but a network of polygonal meshes with radii in the hollows, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 32</a>. The perfect
identity of this structure with that of certain states of the cephalic eyes will at once be
perceived by comparing this figure with <a href="#Plate_IV">figure 26</a> representing the same sort of polyedric
meshes, though a little more regular in the cephalic eye, where, however, the irregularity
also prevails near the periphery of the eye. If we now compare the sections of the
cephalic eye of Ill&aelig;nus Chiron and the section of the regular and nearly unchanged eyes
of Ill. Esmarki with the second section of the latter, we cannot avoid the conclusion that
we in those of Ill. Chiron, <a href="#Plate_IV">figs. 22, 23</a>, and the first of Ill. Esmarki, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 27</a>, see the
primitive and intact state of the lenses and in the last sections of Ill. Esmarki, <a href="#Plate_IV">figs. 26,
28</a>, the changed and deteriorated state of the same prismatic lenses.</p>

<p>The vertical section of the hypostomic eyes <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 33</a> shows in their present changed
condition an evident longitudinal direction of the chief elements, quite as the lenses of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">-59-</span>
the eyes. But in how far there ever has existed such prismatic lenses, now changed, we
have no evidence definitely to ascertain, but the probability seems to be great that this
was the case.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus gigas</b> <span class="smcap">Holm</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 34-37.</a></p>

<p>The macul&aelig; in this as well as the other Ill&aelig;ni are so faintly elevated and so inconspicuous
that the greatest attention is needed to find them.</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; are elongated, narrow, elliptic on the same level and parallel with the
straight anterior margin of the hypostoma. A cast of the left macula is pitted by numerous
marks of the lenticular globules of the surface, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 37</a>. In the cephalic eye the
prisms are seen translucent beneath the cornea. Near the superior border they are larger,
<a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 34</a>, almost the double size of those near the inferior border, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 35</a>.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus sph&aelig;ricus</b> <span class="smcap">Holm</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 42, 43.</a></p>

<p>Comes near to the previous species. The globules on the surface of the elliptic
macul&aelig; are not, however, spread over the entire macula, leaving only a narrow border
all around free.</p>

<p>The lenses in the cephalic eyes <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 42</a> are globular as seen on the surface, alike
those of the macul&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ill&aelig;nus Roemeri</b> <span class="smcap">Vollborth</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 38-41.</a></p>

<p>The macul&aelig; lie on elevated tubercles and are of a strange shape, being sharpely
pointed outwards, rounded inwards. That in <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 39</a> is still more peculiar with a narrow
stripe on the interior and upper margin. The lenses are larger and more distinct than
in any other species of this genus.</p>

<p>Beside the species now mentioned we have also observed hypostomas with macul&aelig;
in Ill&aelig;nus laticlavius <span class="smcap">Eichwald</span> from Estland, in Ill&aelig;nus Linnarssoni <span class="smcap">Holm</span>, and in an
unnamed species from Dalecarlia figured without macula by Dr. <span class="smcap">Holm</span> in his memoir on
the Ill&aelig;nid&aelig; pl. III fig. 22. We have not seen any lenses on the macul&aelig; of these three
lenses.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Lichas</b> <span class="smcap">Dalman</span>.</p>

<p>We have not been able to find any notice about the exceptional macul&aelig; of this
genus. There is only a figure of the hypostoma of Lichas hyl&aelig;us <span class="smcap">Hall</span> Pal. of N. York
vol. VII pl. XXV fig. 5 which would seem to show a pair of narrow, oblique macul&aelig;,
but these are quite without resemblance with the macul&aelig; of the true Lichas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span></p>

<p>The hypostoma of Lichas is of a characteristic type, broad, with the incised posterior
margin and its two lappets reminding of Asaphus, with its large rounded, faintly
elevated median part near the anterior margin reminding of Ill&aelig;nus, as also do the
lenticles of the macul&aelig;. The macul&aelig; are of a minimal size, scarcely 1 millim. in diameter
and thence easily overlooked. <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 46, 48.</a></p>

<p>As the hypostomas in this genus generally are found detached it is often difficult to
decide to which species they have belonged. So it is with that delineated in <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a> fig. 44
natural size. The two macul&aelig; are situated near the centre of the hypostoma, just below
the grooves which surround the large, globular disc. They are sunk in a little cavity,
rounded and entirely covered by globular lenses (<a href="#Plate_IV">pl. IV fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p>In another detached hypostoma of an unknown species the macula is smaller and
the few lenticular globules larger than in the other, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 48</a>.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Lichas latifrons</b> <span class="smcap">Angelin</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV fig. 49.</a></p>

<p>The macul&aelig;, seen in a thin section from the inside, are reticulate, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 49</a>, or of a
pattern exactly like that in the changed eyes or macul&aelig; of Ill&aelig;nus and even Asaphus,
and thus indicating that it was composed of short prismatic lenses. The vertical section
of a macula of a specimen from another locality rather suggests the presence of large
sph&aelig;rical lenses than elongated prisms. The great thinness of the macula in contrast to
the excessive thickness of the shell around the eye is seldom so evident as here.</p>

<p>A specimen of an unknown species, found detached, has the macula? unlike the
other species, oblique with the inferior end directed inwards, placed on the top of a sort
of a little elevation, <a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 47</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">-61-</span></p>

<p>The hypostoma has a large central ovate gibbosity with the macul&aelig; near its basis,
surrounded by the winglike expanded limbus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Megal. attenuata</b> <span class="smcap">Wahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 1-6.</a></p>

<p>The long and narrow macul&aelig; are crescent-shaped and project beyond the hypostoma
supported on the superior surface of a sharp extenuated edge where they rest as on
a shelf. They consist, as seen in vertical sections, <a href="#Plate_V">figs. 5, 6</a>, of alternating rows of light
and black streaks, and in a horizontal section the spongious network appears, as it is
found in Asaphus and others and thus indicating the tendency of this organ to assume
a prismatic structure though undeveloped.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes in M. attenuata form the most regular hexaedral prisms <a href="#Plate_V">fig. 1 a</a>,
short and covered by a thin cornea. The border zone of the eyes has a structure exactly
like that of the macul&aelig;, the same as in the spongious zone of Asaphus.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V fig. 8.</a></p>

<p>The macul&aelig; are crescent-shaped and not so prominent as in Meg. attenuata and
the visual spot in the same position as there.</p>

<p>To observe is that the general structure of the hypostomic shell in this and many

<span class="smcap">Br. II</span> pl. 3 fig. 40.</p>

<p>The hypostoma in this genus is transversal with large lateral expansions, the central
convexity only faintly elevated and almost coherent with the posterior part. The macul&aelig;
lie exactly on the horizontal median line of the hypostoma. The anterior wings are
well developed like slightly bent acuminated horns and the posterior wings are conical
points. The terrace lines are transverse and a little wavy.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 10-15.</a></p>

<p>There is some variability in the hypostoma of specimens from different localities.
The most known and numerous specimens are from the renowned localities of &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland.
They are decidedly transverse, the proportion of the hight to breadth is as 3 to 5
and the narrow border runs all round. In specimens from Kongslena, Vesterg&ouml;tland, the
proportion is as 15 to 22, in specimens from Sandvik, &Ouml;land, again, we have 13 to 23
or 6 to 11. The macul&aelig;, <a href="#Plate_V">fig. 14</a>, are oblong, inwardly pointed, quite smooth, with a
little concavity in their centre, and their surface is slanting obliquely towards the
surface of the hypostoma, almost as in Niobe. There is no trace of any structure.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes are covered by a comparatively thick membrane, a direct continuation
of the general test, <a href="#Plate_V">fig. 12</a>, hiding a row of prismatic lenses. In some specimens
elongate, clear, crystalline rods continue downwards from the bases of the lenses
and are probably nothing but inorganic crystals of calcareous spar, <a href="#Plate_V">fig. 11</a>.&mdash;The eyes
are larger comparatively than in other species.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Nileus (Symphysurus) palpebrosus</b> <span class="smcap">Dalman</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 16-18.</a></p>

<p>As to its general form the hypostoma resembles that of the preceding species, but
there is no border line, which is so characteristic to the former. The macul&aelig; have the
same form and are likewise situated on the median line. The cephalic eyes have prismatic
lenses with much convex bases, in a transverse section they are hexaedral and of
internal radiate structure.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Niobe</b> <span class="smcap">Angelin</span>.</p>

<p>The following figures have formerly been given of its hypostoma with macul&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>N. l&aelig;viceps</i> <span class="smcap">Br. II</span> pl. 2 fig. 34.</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; are distinguished from all other sorts of macul&aelig;, excepting those of
Megalaspis, in being, as it were, shelved on a sort of support, formed through the bulging
of the hypostomic surface just below them, one such console for each. Their surface
lies consequently almost rectangularly to the adjoining surface of the hypostoma. They
are white and smooth.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><b>Niobe frontalis</b> <span class="smcap">Ang.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 19-21.</a></p>

<p>The pocketlike consoles are shorter and broader than in N. l&aelig;viceps and the macul&aelig;
also larger and of an elliptic shape. In a horizontal section near the surface the macula
has a speckled appearance of black dots, indicating an undeveloped prismatic structure,
much more primitive than in the Asaphid&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Niobe l&aelig;viceps</b> <span class="smcap">Ang.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 22-26.</a></p>

<p>It differs from the preceding through longer consoles below the macul&aelig;, which are
oval and in a horizontal section exhibit the same spongious structure, <a href="#Plate_V">pl. V fig. 25</a>. The
cephalic eyes consist of polyedric prisms, which through deterioration show a central
cylindrical core surrounded by darkish matter like Asaphus. The passage from solid,
homogenous prisms to changed ones is most evident in the <a href="#Plate_V">figure 22</a>.</p>

concave macul&aelig;, probably a cast. He compares it with the Entom. bucephalus of <span class="smcap">Wahlenberg</span>,
but says he cannot explain its nature.</p>

<p>The macul&aelig; of P. oelandicus, pl. V, fig. 34, are tubercles, oblong, smooth, and
have invariably an oblong scar along the centre, where probably once a thinner membrane,
as in the cephalic eyes of Calymmene, contained the lenses.</p>

<p>We have given a figure of the hypostoma, showing two large, elongated tubercular
macul&aelig; or rather resemblances of such, as they are covered with terrace lines as well as
the rest of the surface. They have, however, the same position as real macul&aelig; might
have, but are directed in a line parallel with the longitudinal axis of the hypostoma.

<p>Of the following species Ph. cephalotes and Ph. macrophthalmus belong to the
genus Phacops proper, while Phac. quadrilineata, as well as Ph. Downingi&aelig; are of a quite
different generic type. The name Acaste proposed for them is not good as <span class="smcap">Leach</span> in
1817 named a Cirrhiped as Acasta.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ph. cephalotes</b> <span class="smcap">Barr.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 35, 36.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma is elongate, almost triangular, tricuspidate at the posterior border,
a little above this there is a crescent-shaped ridge, and still a little higher above this and
the median horizontal line, the two macula, as diminutive tubercles. Seen with magnifying
powers they are slightly oblong or reniform.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ph. macrophthalmus</b> <span class="smcap">Burm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 1-9.</a></p>

<p>The triangular hypostoma has a little below the median horizontal diameter two
shallow grooves, and a little above the same diameter the extraordinary minute macul&aelig;
may with some care be observed, <a href="#Plate_VI">figs. 8, 9</a>. They are visible as a small bare, smooth
spot amongst the curious elevated and incoherent terrace lines of the surface. The exceedingly
small size of these macul&aelig; naturally does not allow any research of their structure.
They are rather in this species and many of the congeneric to be regarded as
small ocelli. In some specimens these spots are quite rudimentary and are reduced to the
smallest area possible. The anterior wings are of a peculiar earlike shape, finely striate,
enlarged and flat near the hypostoma and ending in a little hollow horn (<a href="#Plate_VI">figs. 6, 7</a>).
A little below it, the posterior wing emerges as a small angular knob. The aggregate
cephalic eyes are more distinct.</p>

<p>As the vertical section learn us the regular ovate lenses consist generally of clear,
crystalline calcareous spar and are on the surface covered by an extremely thin membrane,
not a common one for all, but a separate cornea for each lens, which envelopes
its superior moiety and continues down as a thickened appendix between the lens and
the interstitial test (<a href="#Plate_VI">figs. 3-5</a>). In the horizontal sections it surrounds the lenses as an
annular wall. Around some lenses there is as if still another ring lay outside this, but
more indistinct, probably only clearer portions of the test surrounding them. The cheeks
close to the lenses are indistinctly perforated by longitudinal tubes.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V figs. 37, 38.</a></p>

<p>We have not succeeded in finding any well preserved hypostoma.</p>

<p>The lenses of the cephalic eyes resemble much those of the preceding species though
more elongate and ovate. They are covered by a membrane which surrounds their upper
moiety and between the lenses joins the interstitial test. In the horizontal section these
membranes surround the lenses as an annular wall.</p>

<p>The hypostoma somewhat reminds of that of Calymmene, has projecting angles and
a prominent knob below the straight anterior border. The two oblique and oblong macula
are tubercular and placed near the lateral borders. This hypostoma is upon the
whole much related to that of Phillipsia and Proetus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Phillipsia</b> <span class="smcap">Portlock.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Koninck</span> figured a hypostoma of Phillipsia in his &raquo;Description des Animaux
Foss. de Belgique&raquo; as Cyclus Brongniartianus pl. LII fig. J and <span class="smcap">Nov&aacute;k</span> in III figs. 6, 7

We have been able to examine three different, unnamed or undeterminated species,
which we distinguish by numbering them.</p>

<p><i>Phill. No. 1</i> from the Keokuk group of Crawfordsville, N. America. The hypostoma
is broader than in the other species. The nearly horizontal elongated macul&aelig; placed
near the median line, close to the lateral margins.</p>

<p><i>Phill. No. 2</i> (<a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI, figs. 15-18</a>) probably from the Carboniferous formation of
Belgium is of a lengthened form. The elliptic macul&aelig; in the groove, below the central
elevation. They are smooth and surrounded by a flat border.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes are much destroyed, but seem to have consisted of somewhat
semi-prismatic lenses or prisms of the same type as Dysplanus.</p>

<p><i>Phillipsia No. 3</i> (<a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI figs. 12-14</a>) from the Carboniferous strata of Beeren Eiland
communicated by Hr <span class="smcap">J. G. Andersson</span>. It comes near the preceding, is lengthened,
but has broader and shorter anterior wings and the inferior surface just above the posterior
border peculiarly pitted. The macula lying above this pitted field are ovate. The
lenses of the cephalic eye are hemispheric on the surface.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 50, 51.</a></p>

<p>This genus may well be kept distinguished from Lichas in consequence of its peculiar
hypostoma and its still more peculiar macul&aelig;, not to remind of the other deviating
features. The macul&aelig; lie at the end of narrow, sigmoid grooves of their own above the
long transverse groove, separating the posterior border from the anterior elevated moiety.
They are elongated, curved and entirely covered with a great number of irregular lenticles,
translucent through the thin covering membrane.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><i>Pliomera T&ouml;rnquisti</i> <span class="smcap">Holm</span> in Trilobit. Dalecarliens p. 5 fig. 2.</p>

<p>While Pl. Fischeri and Pl. actinura not have any hypostomic macul&aelig;, this species,
which Dr. <span class="smcap">Holm</span> with some doubt joins in the same genus, has a hypostoma, which as to
its general shape resembles that of both the mentioned species, evenly rounded at its
posterior border, with a shallow groove encircling the central field. A little below the
horizontal diameter of this the macul&aelig; stretch obliquely inwards and downwards. They
rest on a little elevation and are elongate, anteriorly acuminated. The figure on <span class="smcap">Holm's</span>
plate does not show the macul&aelig;.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Proetus</b> <span class="smcap">Steininger</span>.</p>

<p>There are some indistinct indications of macul&aelig; in several of the hypostomas figured
in <span class="smcap">Barrande's</span> Syst&egrave;me pl. 15.</p>

<p><i>Proet. signatus</i> <span class="smcap">Lindstr.</span>, Gotl. Trilob. Pl. XV fig. 17, shows very distinctly the two

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 19-23.</a></p>

<p>In this, as well as in the few other species of Proetus which we have studied,
there is that peculiarity of the surface of the hypostoma that two more or less distinct
ridges form an acute angle just below the faintly arcuated anterior border. The terrace
lines are exactly alike those of the Phillipsi&aelig;, only visible on the central field and
ceasing just above the macul&aelig;, where there is a transverse smooth field. The posterior
margin has two pair of very short points, one on each side. The macula are lengthened
tubercles, somewhat bent and have an oblique position. They are surrounded by tiny
prickles and as seen in <a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 23</a> the macula proper forms a white, elliptic spot on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span>
tubercle. The cephalic eyes are lengthened prisms covered by a thick membrane. They
are convex at their base and in a transverse section they show a radiate structure of
their interior.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Proet. conspersus</i> <span class="smcap">Angelin</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 24-26.</a></p>

<p>We have figured a decorticated hypostoma with impressions of two reniform macul&aelig;.
The vertical sections of the cephalic eyes show a thin stratum where the lenses
are much shorter than in the previous species and covered by a thin film of the common
test. The same is also the case in a species which probably is Proet. verrucosus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><i>Proet. signatus</i> <span class="smcap">Lindstr&ouml;m</span>.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 27-30.</a></p>

<p>On the lateral borders of the hypostoma there are short spines, two on each side,
but they are placed differently on the specimens and even wanting in some. The elongated,
elliptical macul&aelig; bear in their lower end a white spot on which is seen a little
cluster of a varying number of small, segregated ocelli, from three to five, according to
the different specimens, like so many black points. The macul&aelig; attain the exceptional
length of 4,7 millim. in some specimens, but commonly only 2 millim. We have as yet
not been able to detect these remarkable ocelli in any other species of Proetus.</p>


<p class="caption3nb">Ptychoparia <span class="smcap">Corda</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walcott</span> in &raquo;Pal&aelig;ontology of the Eureka District&raquo;, gives on plate X fig. 21 a
representation of a hypostoma which near the posterior margin shows two macul&aelig; as narrow,
crescentlike ridges and above them two longer and thicker ridges directed obliquely
toward the central axis of the hypostoma.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Ptychopyge</b> <span class="smcap">Ang.</span></p>

<p>Previous figures of hypostomas with macul&aelig; are the following:</p>

<p><i>Pt. aciculata</i> <span class="smcap">Br. II</span>, pl. 1 fig. 13.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><b>Pt. aciculata</b> <span class="smcap">Ang.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 40, 41</a></p>

<p>The broad hypostoma bears the elongated, acuminated macul&aelig; in an oblique direction,
contrary to what is seen in most other species. The anterior end slopes inwards and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">-69-</span>
the lower end outwards, the surface, which in the cast drawn is surrounded by a marginal
line, is directed sidewards against the broad lateral wings and is obscured by the
declivity formed by the groove. The same disposition of the mature also occurs in Ptych.
glabrata. These two species consequently in this respect differ essentially from the other
four species which we have examined, but there is for the rest no reason to make these
form different genera or subgenera.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Pt. angustifrons</b> <span class="smcap">Dalm.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 31-36.</a></p>

<p>There are two varieties of hypostomas: one broad <a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 32</a> and one more elongated
<a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 33</a>. The macul&aelig; having a convex surface lie at the inferior end of the lateral grooves
prominent on a semicylindrical support, slightly inclining outwards. In the broad variety
they are oblique (<a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 34</a>) and in the elongated variety they are horizontal (<a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 35</a>). In
a vertical section <a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 36</a> we have the same indications of a prismatic arrangement in the
macul&aelig; as in the Asaphi. The horizontal section does not represent so clear and distinct
a reticulate structure as in the Asaphi, the prisms are much smaller.</p>

<p>The cephalic eyes are composed of closely packed hexaedral prisms, the gradual
change from solid homogenous ones to those which are interiorly destroyed, only with
the exterior form preserved is easily seen. The figure of a horizontal section (<a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 31</a>)
gives a good idea of the peculiar destruction of the interior of these prisms. In the
vertical section the prisms are not discernible.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Pt. cincta</b> <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger?</span> according to <span class="smcap">Friedr. Schmidt</span> in Mus. Holm.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI figs. 37-39.</a></p>

<p>The hypostoma which <span class="smcap">Br&ouml;gger</span> figures (II, pl. I fig. 2 <i>a</i>) as belonging to this species
is completely identical with that of Pt. angustifrons, while the specimens which <span class="smcap">Fr. Schmidt</span>
has marked out as being the true Pt. cincta have a different hypostoma. The macul&aelig;
vary in the specimens, being in some placed horizontally or in a right angle to the
longitudinal axis of the hypostoma, in others, again, a little obliquely outwards. They
form prominent, free lying tubercles. It is from the superior face that the rudimentary
lenses have left their traces, as seen in a longitudinal section (<a href="#Plate_VI">fig. 39</a>). It is consequently
this superior surface which is the macula proper.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Pt. glabrata</b> <span class="smcap">Ang.</span></p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI fig. 42.</a></p>

<p>We have given a figure of the elliptic acuminate macul&aelig; as seen on a cast of the
inside of a hypostoma, the same which is the original to fig. 14 in <span class="smcap">Br. II</span>.</p>

<p>The strange transverse, bipartite hypostoma carries the small, round, tuberculose
macul&aelig; on the superior moiety. As seen from the interior (<a href="#Plate_IV">fig. 53</a>) they are obscurely
maculate, but it is doubtful whether these black dots are derived from lenses, as the
surrounding hypostomic surface also has the same mottled aspect.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><b>Trochurus</b> sp.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV figs. 54, 55.</a></p>

<p>This hypostoma belongs to an unknown species of Trochurus from the Southern
Gotland (Burs). Its macula are placed almost as in the preceding species, but are much
larger. They are surrounded by prominent margins. No lenses have been discovered
on them.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> To these have here been added two Bohemian species P. bohemicus and P. spinosus omitted above
at page 64.</p>

</div>

<p>We have thus 136 species of 39 genera in which hypostomic macul&aelig; have been
found and only 36 species, in which it has been possible to study the structure of the
macul&aelig; through sections.</p>

<p>Common for a great number of macul&aelig; in various groups, whether they show any
organic structure or not, is the excessive thinness of their shell in comparison with that
of the surrounding hypostoma. This is also in accordance with the tenuity of the cephalic
eyes in relation to the test of the cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">-72-</span></p>

<p>The structure which characterizes the macula as a visual organ, although often so
rudimentary, is not in all instances spread through the whole substance of the macula.
This structure has in several species been restricted to a narrow circumference of the
body of the macula, to its interior apex as in Bronteus and Proetus. Only in the Asaphid&aelig;,
in Ill&aelig;nus and Lichas the entire macula shows this structure. Perhaps, to judge
by certain indications in Bronteus, once in a larval or preceding stage of evolution the
whole surface of the macula was also in that genus covered with lenses, which have been
reduced.</p>

<p>The different groups in which the examined genera may be divided are the following
seven, showing the remarkably great diversity of these organs. There is even in the
same genus so great a variability that species with structure in the macula occur along
with those devoid of any structure or also, as in Lichas, with a different structure. It
must, however, be remembered, that the species of such genera may not be coeval.</p>

<p><i>Group 1.</i> In the sectioned macula there is no trace whatever of any structure.
The test of the macula considerably thinner than that of the hypostoma. According to
the affinities of the genera they may be subdivided as follows. <i>a</i> Bumastus, Dysplanus.
<i>b</i> Nileus, Symphysurus, ? Ogygia. <i>c</i> Calymmene, Homalonotus. <i>d</i> Chirurus pro parte.</p>

<p><i>Group 2.</i> The whole macula is of a spongious or irregularly polyedric structure,
showing prisms in vertical sections. Its concordance with the structure of the deteriorated
cephalic eyes or with the so called border zone is complete. If a supposition may be
hazarded, I think that the spongious or reticulate structure in the macul&aelig; is their real
and original state, a lower stage of development of the visual organs, out of which the
prisms in the cephalic eyes have been formed, and that the prismatic lenses in their decay,
as seen in the Asaphid&aelig;, reveal to us their original state and structure, and thus,
as it were, return to the primary stage in the macul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Asaphus, Isotelus, Megalaspis, Ptychopyge, Niobe, ? Megalaspides, ? Barrandia.</p>

<p>Ill&aelig;nus, Lichas, Trochurus, ? Platymetopus.</p>

<p>Encrinurus also probably belongs to this group.</p>

<p><i>Group 3.</i> Macul&aelig; with well developed globular lenses on the interior third of the
macula. The blank part of the macula without any structure. In one instance (Chirurus
spinulosus) the whole macula covered with lenses.</p>

<p>Bronteus, Chirurus spinulosus.</p>

<p><i>Group 4.</i> The macula form sunk pits with smooth bottom. Structure unknown.
In a few species there seems to be no less than four macul&aelig; in two pair above each other.</p>

<p>Dalmanites.</p>

<p><i>Group 6.</i> The elongate straight macul&aelig; carrying on their innermost point from
three to five diminutive, segregate ocelli situated on a clear, white patch. Proetus.</p>

<p>As yet these ocelli have not been observed on the related genera Cyphaspis, Pha&euml;tonides,
Phillipsia and Griffithides, but they may be preliminarily ranked here in consequence
of their close conformity.</p>

<p><i>Group 7.</i> The macul&aelig; have in this group been reduced to a pair of tiny ocelli
situated high up on the hypostoma, near its anterior margin.</p>

<p>Phacops, Acaste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">-73-</span></p>

<p>The position of the hypostomic eyes on the ventral surface of the trilobites is not
quite so abnormous, nor so isolated a feature amongst the crustaceans as might at first
be supposed. Amongst the recent crustacea there is probably none, which as to the conformation
of its labrum or hypostoma resembles the trilobites so closely as the species of
the genus Apus, however different they may else be in all other respects. We have
studied chiefly the hypostoma of Apus cancriformis. In its shape as seen from the outside
and as to its outlines it reminds strongly of the trilobite hypostoma. It is nearly
square (<a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI figs. 46, 47</a>) with rounded corners. The anterior margin is arched and in
the middle it has a broad tonguelike prolongation. On the sides of the anterior margin
there are two short, sharply pointed wings. The lateral margins are thick, almost as
doubled, and bent forward so that a groove is formed alongside them and the large,
evenly vaulted median surface of the hypostoma. These grooves are continued in a short
groove parallel with the posterior margin. From this margin a narrow oblique surface
is slanting backwards, as it were, doubling that margin. On its surface there are two
small, resplendent, white or clear spots, almost of the shape of a crescent, though more
irregular when seen in higher enlargement (<a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI fig. 49</a>). They are translucent as to
be visible on the interior side of the hypostoma. In Apus glacialis there are also similar
spots in the same position, but they form short narrow, straight stripes, parallel with the
border of the posterior margin. I have no opinion as to the nature or function of these
white spots. I do not think that they at all are homologous with the macula; of the
trilobites. On the other hand we see a little higher up on the exterior side of the hypostoma
two faintly elevated elliptic tubercles which as to their position and shape highly
remind of the macul&aelig; of the trilobites. They are hollow on the inside and we have not
been able to find any peculiar structure in them. That they have any visual function is
precluded through the circumstance that the whole exterior surface is densely covered
with microscopic bristles (<a href="#Plate_VI">pl. VI fig. 49</a>) which are especially remarkable along the posterior
margin.</p>

<p>In the class of the Cirrhipedia a sufficient number of facts is known to ascertain
us of the presence of eye spots on the hypostomas of the larva. The researches of
<span class="smcap">Spence Bate</span><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> show in the larva of Balanus balanoides, on the hypostoma or labrum,
which he calls proboscis, an eye, a little from the posterior margin of the labrum. It
seems during the various moults of the animal to have changed its place, being in the
two first moults situated near the anterior margin of the hypostoma. In Clitia Str&ouml;mi it
lies at the anterior part of the labrum (<a href="#Plate_VI">figs. 9, 10</a>). <span class="smcap">Spence Bate</span> does not accept the
opinion of their nature as eyes, but the following authors as <span class="smcap">Darwin</span> and <span class="smcap">Clapar&egrave;de</span>
agree in considering these spots as eyes. <span class="smcap">Darwin</span><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> describes two such eyes in Lepas
australis and, if I catch his meaning rightly, one on each side of the labrum. <span class="smcap">Clapar&egrave;de</span>
has given a figure of the larva of Lepas anatifera<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in the hypostoma of which (by him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>
called &raquo;R&uuml;ssell&raquo;, proboscis) a single eye is seen, having at the sides two round problematic
organs, that he at first considered as auditory cells, but later as eyes. <span class="smcap">Hesse</span><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> has also
in a species of Scalpellum seen several coloured spots on the inferior surface of the carapace,
below the antenn&aelig; and he expressly says that they are eyes and a special pair
of supplemental eyes that are becoming functional after the first moult.</p>

<p>These sternal eyes in the larva are previous to the eyes in the dorsal side of the
later stages and whenever such are discovered in other groups of adult animals as the trilobites
they must of course be considered as remnants from the larval stage. As a rule,
in several tribes of the crustacea it has been observed that the eyes originate on the ventral
or sternal side of the body and in the advancement of growth move to the superior side.
So according to <span class="smcap">Packard</span> and others the embryo of Limulus has originally the median
eyes on the ventral side. In the same way the cephalic eyes of Dalmanites move, as
<span class="smcap">Barrande</span> has shown, from the ventral side to their permanent place on the superior side
of the head shield. But while in the Cirrhipedia the larval or hypostomic eyes are lost
in the adult they remain on the hypostoma of a great number of the adult trilobites and
have probably left their mark behind in A pus. No wonder then that we find these macul&aelig;
developed as precursors of the hypostomic eyes in a number of the oldest and in
other respects blind trilobites as the Olenellid&aelig; and Paradoxid&aelig; to which they may have
been of some use as a sort of visual organs, though probably very imperfect.</p>

<p>We find the macul&aelig; of the trilobites present from the oldest Cambrian times and
we find also in them a progressive evolution, in some to a high degree, lenses and facets,
perfectly identical with those of the eyes on the head shield, converting them into
true eyes. It was in the Lower Silurian times, in the Lower grey Orthoceratite limestone
of Sweden, that Ill&aelig;nus Esmarki appeared provided with actual prismatic lenses on
its macul&aelig; and probably also Lichas. Still higher at the top of the Lower Silurians, in
the Lept&aelig;na limestone of Dalecarlia the genus Bronteus has appeared with those highly
developed hypostomic eyes.</p>

<p>But there are, no doubt, still more facts to adduce for filling up extant lacun&aelig; in
the knowledge of these matters. The material now at hand has, however, not been sufficient
for doing this. At present I must leave this interesting field of investigation and
be contented if I have succeeded in showing where rich harvests await every one who
will make a search for them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
